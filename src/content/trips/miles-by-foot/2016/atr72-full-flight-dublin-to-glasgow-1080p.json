 "description": "Welcome!  This is a full flight video aboard Aer Lingus Flight 3222 with nonstop service from Dublin International Airport to Glasgow International Airport in Scotland aboard an ATR 72-600 turboprop plane!\n\nAfter a short stay in Dublin, my family left the day before St. Patrick's Day to avoid the crowds and continued our journey in Scotland.  We boarded planeside and after a very short delay began taxiing for a cloudy takeoff from Runway 10.  It only took a few minutes to get above the clouds and enjoy the beautiful vistas as we crossed the Irish Sea!  Our flight time was scheduled for less than an hour, and soon we descended through the clouds from the west for a smooth landing at Glasgow International Airport.\n \nThanks again for watching, and enjoy!\n\n--------------------------------\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: Aer Lingus\nOperator: Stobart Air\nFlight Number: EI3222\nDate of Flight: Wednesday, March 16th, 2016\n\nOrigin Airport: Dublin International Airport (EIDW/DUB)\nDestination Airport: Glasgow International Airport (EGPF/GLA)\n\nDeparting Gate: 402\nScheduled Departure: 10:05 GMT\nActual Departure from Gate: 10:09 GMT\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 10 / 10:23 GMT\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 5 / 11:10 GMT\nScheduled Arrival: 11:10 GMT\nActual Arrival at Gate: 11:19 GMT\nArriving Gate: 29\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAircraft Information\nType: ATR 72-600\nRegistration: EI-FAV\nAircraft Delivery: September 2013\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M\nSeat/s: 4D & 4F\n\n--------------------------------\n\nVideo Highlights and Timeline\n00:30 - Engine Start and Taxi\n01:50 - Takeoff\n04:00 - Initial Descent\n04:50 - Approach\n07:00 - Landing\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTechnical Specs\nCamera: Nikon D3200 with 18-55mm lenses\n\nA big thanks to my wife Beth as my assistant throughout the journey!\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

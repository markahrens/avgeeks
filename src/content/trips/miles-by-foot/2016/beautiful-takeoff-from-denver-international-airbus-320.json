 "name": "Beautiful Takeoff from Denver International (Airbus 320)",
 "description": "Welcome!  This is the third in a series of five flight videos relating to my trip to Denver with my wife Beth.  \n\nThis video covers the taxi and takeoff portion of our first leg home, from Denver International Airport to its fellow United Airlines hub, Chicago O'Hare International Airport.  This is the first time I'd flown United Airlines in memory, as I usually fly Delta, Southwest and, occasionally, American.  Flying a substituted Airbus 320 instead of the scheduled Boeing 737 equipment, there was some concern that there would be sufficient room to seat everyone on the smaller aircraft, but soon it was all sorted and we were on our way!  The flight was smooth and the scenery was great, complete with the sun setting behind us!  The scintillating night approach into Chicago will be uploaded soon!\n\nI did a complete, nine-concourse photo tour of Chicago O'Hare following a Windy City walk last March; read about it here!\nhttp://www.milesbyfoot.com/2015/05/walking-windy-city-part-8.html\n\nThanks again for watching, and enjoy!\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: United Airlines\nFlight Number: UA2027\nDate of Flight: Sunday, November 1st, 2015\n\nOrigin Airport: Denver International Airport (KDEN/DEN)\nDestination Airport: Chicago O'Hare International Airport (KORD/ORD)\n\nDeparting Gate: B46\nScheduled Departure: 15:14 MST\nActual Departure from Gate: 15:15 MST\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 8 / 15:37 MST\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 27R / 18:25 CST\nScheduled Arrival: 18:40 CST\nActual Arrival at Gate: 18:38 EDT\nArriving Gate: C17\n\nAircraft Information\nType: Airbus A320-232\nRegistration: N471UA\nAircraft Delivery: March 2001\nEngines: 2x International Aero Engines V2527-A5\nSeat/s: 27A & 27B\n\nVideo Highlights and Timeline\n06:25 - Takeoff\n10:30 - Sunset Behind Us!\n\nTechnical Specs\nCamera: Nikon D3200 with 18-55mm lenses\n\nA big thanks to my wife Beth as my assistant (and often primary) cameraperson throughout the journey!\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

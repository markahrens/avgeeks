 "description": "Thanks for watching this Full Flight Experience!  After a brief visit with family, my sister and I were ready to head home.  The second and final of our return flights left from Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) on a regional jet to our final destination, Blue Grass Airport (LEX) in Lexington, Kentucky.   \n\nDTW is a large commercial hub, and traversing it is both easy and enjoyable.  After a brief tour of the terminal, we’ll taxi and takeoff into clear skies alongside Lake Erie.  After smooth flying across western Ohio, we’ll descend into Lexington in the wake of an autumn storm, making for a bumpy approach and landing.\nThanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy! \n\n--------------------------------\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: Delta Connection (Shuttle America)\nFlight Number: DL5296\nDate of Flight: Sunday, October 2nd, 2016\n\nOrigin Airport: Lehigh Valley International Airport (KABE/ABE)\nDestination Airport: Detroit Metropolitan Airport (KDTW/DTW)\n\nDeparting Gate: A67\nScheduled Departure: 17:40 EDT\nActual Departure from Gate: 17:35 EDT\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 22L / 17:44 EDT\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 22 / 18:31 EDT\nScheduled Arrival: 18:57 EDT\nActual Arrival at Gate: 18:36 EDT\nArriving Gate: B6\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAircraft Information\nType: Embraer E170\nRegistration: N872RW \nAircraft Delivery: September 2006 (Shuttle America in June 2011)\nEngines: 2x GE CF34\nSeat: 17A\n\n--------------------------------\n\nVideo Highlights and Timeline\n01:45 – Boarding\n03:30 – Takeoff\n05:30 – Initial Descent\n08:00 – Final Approach\n08:50 – Landing and Taxi\n10:45 – Gate Arrival and Deplaning\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm lens\nLP Microphone\nGO PRO Hero\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

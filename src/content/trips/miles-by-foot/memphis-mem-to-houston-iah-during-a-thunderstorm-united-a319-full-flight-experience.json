 "description": "Welcome to this Full Flight Experience aboard this United A319 flight from Memphis International Airport to Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport!\n\nAfter ominous forecasts of severe storms and tornados in the Houston area, every passenger was nervous about this morning flight. After a delay in boarding, we pushed off a bit late and took to the sky! This 450-mile flight takes us from the southwest tip of Tennessee to southeastern Texas, miles from the Gulf of Mexico. Not that you can see any of it under those impressive clouds! My thanks to the crew who, despite the delay, conducted the flight beautifully!\n\nThanks for flying with me, and enjoy the ride!\n\nVideo Timeline\n00:00 - Intro\n01:15 – Boarding \n01:55 – Pushback\n02:35 – Taxi\n02:45 – Taxi and Captain's Announcement\n03:30 – Takeoff\n05:40 – Inflight Service\n06:40 – Descent and Impressive Clouds!\n10:25 – Gate Arrival\n\n#flight #unitedairlines #united #airbus #memphis #mem #houston #iah #flightreview #flightreport \n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFlight Information\n\nAirline: United Airlines\n\nFlight Number: UA 571\n\nDate of Flight: Wednesday, October 27th, 2021\n\nOrigin Airport: Memphis International Airport (KMEM/MEM)\n\nDestination Airport: George Bush Intercontinental Airport (KIAH/IAH)\n\nDeparting Gate: C16\n\nBoarding Time: 06:43 CDT\n\nScheduled Departure: 06:45 CDT \n\nActual Departure from Gate: 07:00 CDT\n\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 18C / 07:12 CDT\n\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 26L / 08:30 CDT\n\nScheduled Arrival: 08:33 CDT \n\nActual Arrival at Gate: 08:38 CDT\n\nArriving Gate: E22\n\n\nTotal Flight Time: 1 hour, 18 minutes\n\nTotal Gate-to-Gate: 1 hour, 38 minutes\n\nDistance between Airports: 468 mi/753 km\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAircraft Information\n\nType: Airbus A319\nRegistration: N831UA\nManufacture Date: August 2000\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\n\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\n\nGoPro Hero 7 Black and Suction Mount\n\nFeiyuTech G6 Gimbal\n\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView/ClipStudio\n\nAircraft and flight information from planespotters.net and flightaware.com.\n\nArt and Icons by Beth McLain\nIG: bethmclain.art\n\nMap graphics and information from OpenStreetMap.com. © OpenStreetMap contributors\n\nThis video and its audio are not endorsed by, nor affiliated in any way with United Airlines, Inc. or their affiliated companies, as well as either airport and the associated airport authorities featured in this video.

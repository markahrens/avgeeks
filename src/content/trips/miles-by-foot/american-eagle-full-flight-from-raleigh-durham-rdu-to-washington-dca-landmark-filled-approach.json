 "description": "Welcome to this Full Flight Experience aboard an American Eagle Embraer 175 from Raleigh-Durham International Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport!\n\nAfter collecting the footage I needed for my tours so far on this trip, I had to connect to Washington, DC, and there's no better way, in my opinion, than DCA, a conveniently-located, manageable airport just outside the heart of the capitol. While the flight was delayed, the service itself was excellent, and the views were awesome!\n\nThis flight takes us from central North Carolina just one state up to the edge of the District of Columbia and Virginia, complete with great views of the airfield from above, the National Mall, and many landmarks as we make the famous Potomac River approach from the north into DCA. My thanks to the crew who, despite the delay, conducted the flight beautifully!\n\nThanks for flying with me, and enjoy the ride!\n\nVideo Timeline\n00:00 - Intro\n01:10 – Boarding \n01:45 – Pushback\n02:20 – Buyer's Remorse\n02:45 – Taxi and Captain's Announcement\n03:55 – Takeoff\n06:00 – Beverage Service\n06:30 – Flyover of DCA and National Mall\n09:15 – Ground Delays and Personal Anguish\n10:45 – Gate Arrival\n\n#aviation #travel #raleigh #rdu #dca #reagan #americanairlines #embraer #embraer170 #washingtondc \n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFlight Information\n\nAirline: Republic Airways o/a American Eagle\n\nFlight Number: AA 4736\n\nDate of Flight: Monday, June 28th, 2021\n\nOrigin Airport: Raleigh-Durham International Airport (KRDU/RDU)\n\nDestination Airport: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (KDCA/DCA)\n\n\nDeparting Gate: C25\n\nBoarding Time: 12:42 EDT\n\nScheduled Departure: 12:20 EDT (after delay)\n\nActual Departure from Gate: 12:54 EDT\n\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 5L / 13:10 EDT\n\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 19 / 13:55 EDT\n\nScheduled Arrival: 13:25 EDT (after delay)\n\nActual Arrival at Gate: 14:25 EDT\n\nArriving Gate: 52\n\n\nTotal Flight Time: 45 minutes\n\nTotal Gate-to-Gate: 1 hour, 31 minutes\n\nDistance between Airports: 227 mi/365 km\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n\nAircraft Information\n\nType: Embraer E175\n\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n\nGear\n\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\n\nGoPro Hero 7 Black and Suction Mount\n\nFeiyuTech G6 Gimbal\n\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView/ClipStudio\n\n\n\nAircraft and flight information from planespotters.net and flightaware.com.\n\nArt and Icons by Beth McLain\nIG: bethmclain.art\n\nMap graphics and information from OpenStreetMap.com. © OpenStreetMap contributors\n\n\n\nThis video and its audio are not endorsed by, nor affiliated in any way with Republic Airways, Inc., American Airlines Group Inc., or their affiliated companies, as well as either airport and the associated airport authorities featured in this video.

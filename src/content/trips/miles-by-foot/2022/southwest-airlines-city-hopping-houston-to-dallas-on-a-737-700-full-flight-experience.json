 "description": "Welcome to this Full Flight Experience aboard a Boeing 737-700 flight from William P. Hobby Airport in Houston to Dallas Love Field! This frequently flown route ferries Southwest passengers between two of their busiest hubs in the largest cities in Texas. Today, we were treated to beautiful city views of both downtowns under a crystal clear October sky. Even though we were in the air for less than an hour, there was tons to see and take in on this smooth, no-frills flight!\n\nThanks for flying with me, and enjoy the ride!\n\nVideo Timeline\n00:00 - Intro\n00:30 – Boarding \n00:55 – Pushback and Taxi\n01:35 – Takeoff\n02:30 – Downtown Houston View and Timelapse\n03:30 – Descent and View of Downtown Dallas\n04:25 – Landing\n07:45 – Gate Arrival\n08:20 - End Screen\n\n#flight #southwestairlines #b737 #dallas #houston #hou #dal #flightreview #flightreport \n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFlight Information\n\nAirline: Southwest Airlines\n\nFlight Number: SW 6\n\nDate of Flight: Thursday, October 28th, 2021\n\nOrigin Airport: William P.

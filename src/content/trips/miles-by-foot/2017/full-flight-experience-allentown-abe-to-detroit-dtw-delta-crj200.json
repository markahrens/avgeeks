 "description": "Thanks for watching this Full Flight Experience!  After a brief visit with family, my sister and I were ready to head home.  The first of our return flights left from Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE), a small, regional hub in eastern Pennsylvania toward Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), one of Delta’s largest hubs.   \n\nFirst, this video covers the initial arrival at LVIA, a brief tour of their modest terminal, our plane’s arrival, boarding, pushback, and taxi.  From there, you’ll get a nice view during takeoff as we climb through the low-altitude clouds and emerge in a beautiful mid-afternoon sky.  After a short time in the air, we make a unique approach into DTW, complete with low cumulus clouds on final approach.\n\nSpecial thanks to my sister for putting up with my strange requests and switching seats with me!\n--------------------------------\nFlight Information\nAirline: Delta Connection (Expressjet)\nFlight Number: DL5296\nDate of Flight: Sunday, October 2nd, 2016\n\nOrigin Airport: Lehigh Valley International Airport (KABE/ABE)\nDestination Airport: Detroit Metropolitan Airport (KDTW/DTW)\n\nDeparting Gate: 10\nScheduled Departure: 12:55 EDT\nActual Departure from Gate: 13:00 EDT\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 6 / 13:08 EDT\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 21L / 14:35 EDT\nScheduled Arrival: 14:41 EDT\nActual Arrival at Gate: 14:41 EDT\nArriving Gate: B8\n\n--------------------------------\nAircraft Information\nType: Bombardier CRJ-200ER\nRegistration: N927EV \nAircraft Delivery: September 2003 (Expressjet in December 2011)\nEngines: 2x GE CF34-3B1\nSeat: 11A\n\n--------------------------------\nVideo Highlights and Timeline\n00:10 – ABE Terminal Tour\n00:40 – Plane Approaching Gate\n01:00 – Boarding\n01:30 – Pushback and Taxi\n02:50 – Takeoff\n04:30 – At Altitude\n06:00 – Initial Descent\n06:00 – Initial Descent\n10:00 – Final Approach\n11:30 – Landing and Taxi\n13:20 – Gate Arrival and Deplaning\n\n--------------------------------\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm lens\nLP Microphone\nGO PRO Hero\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

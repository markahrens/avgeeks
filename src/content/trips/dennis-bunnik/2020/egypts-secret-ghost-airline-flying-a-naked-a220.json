Massive thanks again to Dashlane for sponsoring this video.\n\nAir Sinai offers the only direct air link between Egypt & Israel, flying between Cairo and Tel Aviv.  Air Sinai is a secret one-route airline, a paper airline, that is owned by Egypt Air but is not advertised as such.  You'll find no record of this route on the Egypt Air website, nor does it feature on its route maps.  The aircraft used by Air Sinai are naked - that is they have no branding. \n\nIt's a fascinating airline and a very interesting route used mainly by international tourists visiting the Middle East.  \n\nAir Sinai recently started flying the new Airbus A220 (previously Bombardier CS300) on this route so join me and we'll experience it together. \n\nFlight Details:\n\nRoute:    Tel Aviv (TLV) to Cairo (CAI) \nLength:  244 miles,  0:53 hrs\nFlight:     4D-55\nWhen:    27 Jan 2020\nAircraft:  Airbus A220 (Bom CS300)   registration SU-GFA - Oct 2019\nSeat:       36B & 40A\nCamera:  Panasonic HC-VX1 and GoPro 8 Black",

Until Singapore Airlines refurbished their own First Class Suites no other first class came close to this Etihad A380 First Class product.  It is a truly incredible, indulgent, luxury experience.  Joint me and we'll do it together.   \n\nRoute:    Abu Dhabi to Melbourne - 13:50 hrs\nFlight:     EY460\nWhen:    August 2017\nAircraft:  Airbus A380   registration A6APB\nSeat:       3A\nClass:    Etihad First Class Apartments\nCamera:  Sony FDR-AXP55\n\nThis video may not be copied or reproduced without written permission.",

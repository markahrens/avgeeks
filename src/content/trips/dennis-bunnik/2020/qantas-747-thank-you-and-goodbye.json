 "description": "What an absolute honour and privilege it was to be one of the lucky few who were able to buy a ticket for the very last Qantas 747 passenger flight. \n\nThe Queen of the Skies, the Boeing 747 jumbo, changed aviation and travel forever.  It opened the world and it revolutionised air travel.\n\nNow after 49 years it was time for Qantas to say goodbye to the 747, the queen of the skies as the final Qantas 747 retires.  To celebrate Qantas flew 3 last flights - one hour joy flights to say goodbye in Sydney, Brisbane and finally Canberra.  It was this last flight in Canberra that I was one and has been captured in this video. \n\nJoin me as I bid the Qantas 747 farewell and pay tribute the the aircraft that made me fall in love with aviation and has enabled me to experience my love to travel over these many years.  \n\nFlight Details\n\nQantas 747 Retirement - Qantas 747 Farewell - Final Qantas 747 Passenger Flight\nDate:   Friday 17 July 2020\nFlight Number:  QF747\nFrom:  Canberra, Australia (CBR)\nTo: Canberra, Australia (CBR)\nAircraft:  Boeing 747-400-ER  Reg: VH-OEJ (July 2003)\n\nLinks:  \nCheck out Seth's photography, it is stunning.  \nSeth Jaworski www.sjap.smugmug.com \n\nVisit HARS Aviation Museum in Wollongong, it's incredible\nwww.hars.org.au\n\nPaul Stewart - one very cool Aussie YouTuber\nHere's Paul's final QF747 flight video: https://youtu.be/EyuoX3tDWGw\n\nThank you and happy travels, \n\nCheers\n\nDennis\n\ncopyright of this video is owned by Dennis Bunnik and this video cannot be reproduced, used or copied without permission.",

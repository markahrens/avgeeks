 "description": "This is what happens when two globe trotting aviation YouTubers have their flying rights removed by a nasty virus!\n\nThe man, the legend Jeb Brooks https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsQLTECz1bCA56JIryaw-lA\nand your's truly don't need much encouragement to talk into a camera.  We are therefore very pleased to launch the first episode of our Q&A chat series.  \n\nWe haven't settled on a name yet so for the moment it's Have Passports, Can't Travel.  Episode 1: Jeb & Dennis Talk Rubbish.  it's a mouthful I know so let us know if you can think of anything better. \n\nWe asked the our very kind and loyal subscribers if they had any questions.  It turns out they had heaps and in this first episode we do eventually get around to answering some of them.  Mainly though it is just Jeb and I chewing the fat, having a chat and catching up over zoom in the new reality that is 2020.  \n\nSo grab yourself a drink, find a comfy spot and join us for a bit of a chat.  \n\nEpisode 2 will be out soon and will be released on Jeb's channel.",

 "description": "Since its launch in 2017 Qatar's Q Suite has set the standard in international business class.  But does it live us to its hype?  Is it still as good as it was?  Does it really match other airlines' First Class?\n\nThese questions will be answered as I revisit the Qatar Q Suite in this business class flight review.  \n\nMy flight onboard the Qatar A350 from Doha to Adelaide was 13 hours long so plenty of time to experience every luxury that the Qatar Airways Q-Suite has to offer.  \n\nJoin me and let's experience Qatar Airways Q Suite business class together.  \n\nHere are the links I refer to in the video:\n\nChannel Update - Getting through covid wearing 3 hats:  https://youtu.be/7KjoGvTiFqo\nQatar Q Suite - testing the Quad Seats:  https://youtu.be/9TvsoFCCGLY\n\nFlight Details:\n\nRoute:    Doha (DOH) to Adelaide (ADL) \nLength:  7,044 miles,  12:47 hrs\nFlight:     QR914\nWhen:    10 Feb 2020\nAircraft:  Airbus A350-900   registration A7-AMJ - Apr 2019\nSeat:       1A\nCamera:  Panasonic HC-VX1 and GoPro 8 Black",

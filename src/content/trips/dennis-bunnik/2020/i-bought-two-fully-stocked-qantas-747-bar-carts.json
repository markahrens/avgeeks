 "name": "I Bought Two Fully Stocked Qantas 747 Bar Carts!",
 "description": "Earlier this year Qantas sadly retired their entire 747 fleet.  However they managed to hold on to their bar carts and after filling them up with Qantas goodies they recently sold them to eager aviation fans.   All 1,000 carts sold out within 90 minutes!  I was lucky enough to secure 2 of them - one full sized and one half sized. \n\nThese Qantas 747 bar carts are part of aviation history and I can't tell you how excited I was when my order was confirmed.    Join me on this video as I break the seal on each of the Qantas 747 bar carts and reveal what's inside.  My first ever unboxing video!\n\nHere's my video of the final ever Qantas 747 passenger flight:  https://youtu.be/WIIVJnjgGiY\n\nGIVE AWAY DETAILS\nTo enter put the words (QF Bar Cart) in a comment below.  Include the brackets as this will make it easier for me to identify the entries. \n\nThe winner will be selected at random on 2 November 2020 - 30 days after this video was released.\n\nThe winner will be announced in the comments below and on my Instagram page so follow me there. \n\nPrize is:  1 Qantas business class pjs and 1 Qantas business class amenities kits plus postage to you.",

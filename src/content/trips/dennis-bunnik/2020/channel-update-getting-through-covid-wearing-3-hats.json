 "name": "Channel Update: Getting through COVID wearing 3 hats.",
 "description": "Finally, after almost 3 months it's time to start uploading again.  But before I recommence normal programming here's a quickish update on what I've been up to.  \n\nCOVID has been tough on all of us - I certainly don't think I had it anywhere near as bad as most other people.  However I have had the unique experience of wearing 3 different hats during this time...  \n\nFirst up I'm an aviation YouTuber specialising in flight reviews.  \n\nSecondly I'm a part owner of, and help run, the family tour business Bunnik Tours.  We run small group tours ex Australia all over the world and as you would imagine the last few months have been about getting our clients and our team through the nightmare of COVID. \n\nAnd finally for the last 5 years I have been the Chair of the Council of Australian Tour Operators (CATO).  Our members create, supply and deliver the travel you buy online or through your local travel agency.  Through my role at CATO I have been helping our industry navigate its way through its biggest ever crisis. \n\nMy priorities over the past few months have been our clients, our staff, my industry and my mental health.  As a result I haven't had the headspace to upload any videos - nor did it feel right to upload flight reviews from what now seems to be a different era.  \n\nThanks for taking the time to watch this update.  Thank you also to all the people who have reached out and wished me and our business well during this difficult time.  I really appreciate it. \n\nLinks referred to in the video:\n\nCATO COVID travel refunds video: https://youtu.be/ec_DNdnqMG8\n\nLittle Windmill Marketing https://www.littlewindmillmarketing.com.au/\n\nBunnik Tours https://www.bunniktours.com.au/\n\nKLM Video:  https://youtu.be/zdWNTI-GifA",

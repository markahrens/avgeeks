 "description": "The Bar is Back and it’s time for Fun in the Air!\n\nYes the Emirates Bar in the Sky on the iconic A380 is back!\n\nJoin me as I reunite with the Emirates business class bar in the sky on a fun flight from Dubai to Cairo, Egypt.  \n\nThis was my first A380 and my first Emirates flight in over 2 years so to say I was excited was an understatement – more like a kid in a candy store as I savoured every moment of the Emirates A380 business class experience.  This experience starts at Dubai Airport and the incredible business class lounge in Concourse A which allowed you to board your A380 direct from the lounge – no queues, no waiting. \n\nThis Emirates Business Class Flight Review includes enough aircraft action to satisfy the biggest avgeek. Business travellers will appreciate the tour of the seat and the facilities offered on board including the meal and drink service by the lovely Emirates Crew.\n\nOf course I also check out Emirates famous ICE entertainment system. \n\nBut the real fun starts after lunch when I head to the back of the upper deck of the super jumbo Airbus A380.  Here Emirates has created the coolest bar in the sky exclusively available to business and first class passengers.\n\nThis video cannot be copied or used commercially without written approval by Dennis Bunnik.\n\n#emiratesA380bar #emiratesbusinessclass",

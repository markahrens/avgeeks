 "name": "Royal Jordanian and Petra with Jeb Brooks",
 "description": "This is what travel is all about!  After years of covid lockdowns and border closures we are finally able to reconnect with the world and each other.  \n\nNow that borders are open catching up with great mate and fellow YouTuber Jeb Brooks was at the very top of my to do list.  As luck would have it we were both flying into Amman Jordan on the same day.  Jeb coming in on the inaugural United Airlines flight from Washington DC and me from Cairo Egypt. \n\nWe couldn't let this opportunity pass to jointly film a flight review on Royal Jordanian flying their regional business class. And of course I had to show Jeb Brooks one of my favourite spots in the entire world - the amazing lost city of Petra. \n\nRoyal Jordanian Business Class on the A320 is excellent and Jeb Brooks and I review it in full including the onboard dining and the Royal Jordanian business class seat. \n\nIn Petra we explored every nook and cranny of this amazing site including the famous Treasury.  I even make Jeb Brooks walk all the way up to the Monastery for the most amazing views.  We end our visit to Petra as all good visits to Petra should end - enjoying a beer at the Cave Bar talking rubbish with an old mate. \n\nEnjoy this video - we had an absolute ball making it. \n\nHere's the link to Jeb's United Airlines video: https://youtu.be/VmDug1xUYj0\n\nIf you haven't subscribed to Jeb's channel yet do so whilst watching his United video above. \n\nThanks for watching and happy travels\n\ncheers\n\nDennis\n\n#RoyalJordanian #Petra #JebBrooks",

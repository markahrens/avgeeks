 "name": "My Failed Delta Economy Class Review",
 "description": "The plan was to review my economy class flight with Delta from Seattle to Las Vegas and it was all going so well right up to the moment of boarding.\n\nMy boarding pass didn't scan properly.  We tried again but it was clear this one was a dud. Instead I was issued a new one with the words we all love to hear - You've been Upgraded!\n\nAnd with that went my economy class flight review. \n\nSo now I present to you Delta's domestic first class instead. \n\nSit, relax and enjoy the ride!\n\ncheers\n\nDennis\n\nLink for Jeb Brooks Denver Airport Operations Video:  https://youtu.be/pgTstGlM9x0\n\n#delta #fligthreview\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:34 Security\n01:48 Gate-side Plane Spotting\n03:29 Boarding\n04:45 Departure\n05:11 Cabin and Seat\n06:07 Delta Entertainment System\n06:49 Inflight Meal Service\n07:48 Landing",

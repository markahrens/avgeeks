 "description": "Most airlines allow their top tier frequent flyers and their top tier alliance partners to access their first class lounge.  Not Qatar!  Qatar's most exclusive lounge, the Al Safwa First Class Lounge at Doha, is reserved strictly for first class passengers. \n\nOr is it?  I found and enjoyed a quirk in the Qatar system.  Business class flights from Doha to Cairo are designated First Class by Qatar Airways.  This gives business class passengers to Cairo access to Al Safwa.\n\nSo naturally I brought my camera along and can now show you exactly what lies behind those exclusive doors!\n\nAnd then to make my day even better I discovered upon boarding that there had been an aircraft change on the Cairo flight and I was now flying the famous Qatar Q-Suite - the world's best business class!!\n\nJoin me and we'll do it together!\n\nCheers \n\nDennis\n\nTesting Qatar's Most Exclusive Lounge followed by a Q-Suite Surprise!\nThe copyright of this video belongs to me.

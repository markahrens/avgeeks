And Cappadocia serves up the very best as you join up to 150 hot air balloons floating over this magic landscape. \n\nI filmed this in May 2022 as I joined the first Bunnik Tour group back to Turkey post-covid.  It was an amazing experience and we jumped at the opportunity to take to the sky in a hot air balloon. \n\nFor more details on Bunnik Tours small group touring program visit: https://www.bunniktours.com.au/\n\nHot Air Balloon Turkey - Cappadocia Balloon Ride  \n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:54 Take Off\n01:46 Dance of the Balloons\n03:17 The Verdict!\n04:03 The Landing\n\n#cappadociaturkey #hotairballoon #turkey",

 "description": "Singapore Airlines long-haul business class is amongst the very best in the sky.  But how good is their second best, or regional, business class?   Watch this video to find out. \n\nJoin me as I fly from Singapore to Adelaide on Singapore Airlines regional business class on board the Airbus A350.  This is the business class product that Singapore Airlines flies into Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth as well as Asian cities within 4-6 hours from Singapore. \n\nThis is a full Singapore Airlines business class flight review including the Singapore Airlines SilverKris business class lounge at Changi Airport and then the full inflight experience including the luxury seating, inflight dining and of course the wonderful service from the Singapore Airlines Cabin Crew. \n\nThis video was filmed in February 2022 so all references to covid restrictions and recovery are accurate for that time. These things change so check with your travel agent or airline for the latest requirements. \n\nCheck out my channel for more flight reviews and travel videos.

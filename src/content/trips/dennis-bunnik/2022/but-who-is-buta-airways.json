 "description": "So who is Buta Airways?  Well I'd certainly never heard of them and certainly wasn't expecting to fly them as I turned up for my flight from Baku to Tbilisi. \n\nIt turns out Buta Airways is the low cost regional carrier owned by Azerbaijan Airways and is based, like it's big brother, in Baku. \n\nThis flight review covers the full Buta Airways experience from boarding through to our arrival in Tbilisi Georgia.  But before we board Buta I'll show you around the beautiful Baku International Airport Terminal - it's a stunning little airport and well worth checking out. \n\nEnjoy the Buta way. \n\nHappy Travels\n\n#buta #azerbaijan #flightreview",

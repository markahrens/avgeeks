It is travel in the lap of luxury on the world's best designed airline KLM, Royal Dutch Airlines.  \n\nThis is KLM's Best Seat. \n\nThis KLM Business Class Flight Review covers the entire KLM business class experience from dedicated Sky Priority Check-in at Amsterdam Schiphol through to the KLM Crown Business Class Lounge and then the wonderful onboard service by the friendly and efficient KLM cabin crew. \n\nThis was an evening flight so I got to experience both dinner and breakfast which were served on the most beautiful crockery in the sky. \n\nJoin me and let's fly together on KLM's Best Seat. \n\n#KLM #KLMBusinessClass #AirlineDesign",

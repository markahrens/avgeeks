 "description": "It's finally happened!  After many years of waiting I finally took the plunge and lost my Ryanair virginity!\n\nMy first ever Ryanair flight was between Venice and Fes. Which demonstrates perfectly the value and advantage of low cost carriers such as Ryanair and their ability to link secondary cities.\n\nThis Ryanair flight review - entitled Losing my Ryanair Virginity - covers the entire process from booking to checkin to boarding, the inflight experience and landing in Fes.  \n\nAs this was my first Ryanair experience I ticked all the boxes and took all the optional extras.  This gave me a flexible ticket, in person check-in, extra luggage and priority boarding and seating.  I even pre-ordered my inflight meal!  \n\nSo join me as I experience the very best that Ryanair has to offer on this Ryanair Flight Review. \n\nFlight Date:  24 May 2022\nFlight Number: FR5371\nFlight Route: Venice Treviso, Italy to Fes, Morocco (TSF-FEZ)\nFlight Duration: 2:54\n\n#ryanair #flightreview #ryanairreview",

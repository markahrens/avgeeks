 "description": "Etihad business class is one of the best in the sky - until you fly their smaller Airbus A320 aircraft!\n\nThis business class flight review shows you exactly what to expect when you fly business class on one of Etihad's smaller aircraft - the A320 and A321.  These smaller narrow bodied aircraft are used for regional services but also for much longer flights to some European cities, Asia and Africa.  These flights can be up to 5, 6 or 7 hours.  \n\nThis flight review covers boarding, take off, the Etihad business class seat, inflight entertainment and the excellent Etihad on-board service and dining. \n\nMy review of the Etihad A330 business class can be found here:  https://youtu.be/bMqR93qXXEg\n\nFor further reviews including Emirates, Qatar, Singapore Airlines, Qantas, LATAM, Turkish Airlines and Egypt Air check out my channel DennisBunnik Travels\n\nThanks for watching and happy travels",

 "description": "Was flying across Australia yesterday on a Qatar A350 when I spotted its big brother the A380 flying just below us.  \n\nI was on QR914 from Doha to Adelaide on the A350 at about 41,000 feet. \n\nThe other aircraft is QR908 from Doha to Sydney - an A380 flying at  about 38,000 feet.\n\nToo cool not to share straight away - my flight review of the Qatar A350 business class will be up in a few weeks - will add link in here when it's up.  \n\nHappy Travels\n\nDennis",

 "name": "British Airways 787 Business Class.  Is it any better?",
 "description": "When British Airways purchased the new 787 aircraft they had the chance to fix some of the serious issues with the design of their business class seats....did they take this opportunity??\n\nWell, no.\n\nOn this flight review I cover the excellent British Airways first class lounge at Heathrow Terminal 5.  I then move to to boarding, take off, the BA business class cabin, the unique British Airways business class seat, the inflight service, crew, meals amenities kit and the entertainment system. \n\nThis flight review was primarily filmed on BA  from London Heathrow to Cairo, Egypt.  However some of the footage is also from a flight from Cairo to Heathrow one week earlier.  \n\nFor more flight reviews including British Airways 747, Qatar, Qantas, Emirates, Cathay Pacific, Etihad, Turkish Airlines, LATAM and Baltic Air please check out my channel. \n\nFlight:     BA155\nRoute:    London Heathrow to Cairo\nWhen:    May 2017\nAircraft:  Boeing 787-9   registration GZBKH\nSeat:       12K\nCamera:  Sony FDR-AXP55",

These seats are amazing!  Each seat is its own little cabin with a closing door to give total privacy. \n\nThe seats in the middle are grouped into pods of 4 which can be opened up so that families and business colleagues travelling together can all see each other, eat together or celebrate special occasions - just like I did on this flight where we celebrated my  parent's 49th wedding anniversary.  \n\nThis business class flight review covers the new Qatar Q-Suite Business Class on their Boeing 777 aircraft.  The review covers checking, the Qatar Heathrow Business Lounge, boarding, take-off, the famous Qatar in-flight service and of course the seat which converts into a lay flat bed.  \n\nThis flight was filmed on QR 8 from London Heathrow to Doha.  See below for more details.   \n\nFor more videos check out my channel where you'll find a range of airline reviews in economy, business and first class including Emirates, British Airways, Etihad, Qatar, Qantas, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, LATAM, Baltic Air, Turkish Airlines and more\n\nRoute:    London Heathrow to Doha\nLength:  3,259miles, 6:35 hrs\nFlight:     QR8\nWhen:    November 2017\nAircraft:  Boeing 777-300ER   registration A7-BEL\nSeat:       2E\nCamera:  Sony FDR-AXP55\nMusic:  \n\nThis video is sponsored by Squarespace however I retain total editorial control and all opinions are my own.  \n\nThis video may not be reproduced without specific permission.",

 "name": "Getting Close: Rwanda Mountain Gorillas",
 "description": "Here's another video of my recent trip to Africa and features the incredible Mountain Gorillas in Rwanda.  This was a truly incredible experience. \n\nThis video was originally made for Bunnik Tours - my real job - it's our family company.  We create small group tours around the world specifically designed for the Australian market.  More details at www.bunniktours.com.au\n\nThe reason I've also posted this video here is to give this experience a wider audience and show how tourism when done right can be a powerful force for good helping the environment, the local community and the traveller.  And this video makes a nice change from endless flight review :) \n\nThat said, more flight reviews coming up in the next few weeks including Qatar A350 in business and economy and Rwandair!\n\nCamera:  Sony Handycam FDR-AXP55\n\nThanks for watching and as always, happy travels!",

 "description": "Finally found the time to do that Q&A video.   Thanks heaps for all the questions - hopefully I've managed to answer most of them.  If not please let me know via comment below. \n\nAlso included in this video are my plans for 2018 and a quick review of the Qantas 737 domestic economy class which I filmed on my 74th flight of the year a few days ago. \n\nMy apologies for the poor editing quality of this video - my mate who's a professional editor who normally does all my editing is on holiday so I thought I'd give it a go myself.  \n \nEnjoy and all the best for a sensational 2018!\n\nHere are the links referred to in the video:\n\nMy Work:    www.bunniktours.com.au\nMy Work YouTube:   https://www.youtube.com/bunniktours\nEtihad A380 First Class Apartment:  https://youtu.be/vAl5AFzQyIo",

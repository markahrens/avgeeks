 "description": "Flight review of Emirates First Class in the 777 aircraft on a flight from Dubai to Adelaide.  The Emirates First Class product is the same in both its Boeing 777 and Airbus A380 aircraft - however I think the 777 First Class product is the better one - watch this video to find out why. \n\nReview covers First Class Lounge in Dubai, boarding, in-flight service, first class seat/suite, the seat in bed configuration and in-flight dining.   I hope you enjoy this video - check out my other flight reviews on DennisBunnik Travels.",

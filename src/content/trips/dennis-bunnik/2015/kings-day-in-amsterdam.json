 "description": "The Dutch king has his birthday on 27 April - and the whole country helps him celebrate.  This year I was lucky enough to be in Holland so thought I'd join the party.  The Kings Day celebrations in Amsterdam are one of Europe's great street parties.  So put on some orange and join the fun.  \n\nKings Day 2015  Amsterdam",

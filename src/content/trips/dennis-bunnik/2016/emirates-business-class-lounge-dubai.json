 "description": "The Emirates Business Class Lounge in Dubai Airport Concourse A is huge!  It runs the entire length of the terminal and entry onto your flight is direct from the lounge.  This lounge review covers the general lounge areas, the shower facilities, business facilities and the wonderful food and drinks on offer.  The business class lounge is an integral part of flying business class and is an experience not to be missed - as in all things Dubai this is bigger and better than most business lounges found anywhere else in the world.   The lounge is open to Emirates Business Class passengers and higher tier SkyWard Frequent Flyer members.  Qantas Business Class passengers and Gold Frequent Flyer members can also use this lounge.",

 "name": "Europe's Coolest Little Airline: Air Baltic Business Class",
 "description": "Air Baltic is one of Europe's coolest airlines.  Here I review the Air Baltic business class product on its Dash 8 aircraft.  \n\nI flew from Kiev to Riga which is a flight of just under 2 hours.  I never knew anybody did business class in the Dash 8 but it turns out that Air Baltic does and does it very well indeed. \n\nThis business class flight review video covers boarding, the business class seat, cabin, inflight entertainment system and the breakfast served on board.  \n\nFor more videos see my channel DennisBunnik Travels.

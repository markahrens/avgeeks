 "name": "Istanbul Business Class Lounge - Turkish Airines",
 "description": "I rate the Turkish Airlines Istanbul Lounge as the best business class lounge I have seen anywhere in the world.  \n\nThe Istanbul Lounge is huge.  But it is not just the size - what this lounge does better than any other is that it is a true showcase of the country it is located in rather than just another bland business class lounge.  Which makes a wonderful change for regular business travelers.\n\nTurkish food, Turkish culture and Turkish drink is featured throughout the lounge withe live cooking stations that change throughout the day.  This lounge is a wonderful advert for Turkey.  \n\nThe Istanbul Lounge has a range of features including showers, computer terminals, various relaxation areas, golf simulator, race track, pool table and movie theatre.    All of these are featured on this review video - enjoy!\n\nTurkish Airlines is part of Star Alliance.",

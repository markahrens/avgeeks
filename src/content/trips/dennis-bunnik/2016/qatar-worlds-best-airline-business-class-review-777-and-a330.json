 "name": "Qatar - World's Best Airline?  Business Class Review 777 & A330",
 "description": "Qatar Airways has been named the world best airline a number of times.   Are they really that good?  Watch this flight review video to find out.  On this review I cover both the Boeing 777 and the Airbus A330 aircraft as I fly from Perth Australia to Barcelona Spain.  \n\nThe video features the airport lounges in Perth and Doha, in-flight dining, the business class cabin, the Qatar Oryx in-flight entertainment system,  Qatar amenities kit and pjs, the business class seat which converts in to a fully flat bed and the service of the Qatar Airways business class cabin crew.  \n\nOne great feature of Qatas Airways is its true ala carte dining in business class which means you can order any dish from any the entire menu whenever it suits you - there are no set mealtimes. This feature, where available on other airlines, is usually limited to first class.  \n\nI hope you enjoy this flight review video - for more flight reviews see my channel DennisBunnik Travels.  Even better is to subscribe then you'll be kept up to date with any new video releases. \n\nThanks for watching!\n\nHappy travels\n\nDennis",

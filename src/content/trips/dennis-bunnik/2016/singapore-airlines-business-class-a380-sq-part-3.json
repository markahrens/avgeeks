It covers my flight from Zurich to Singapore on SQ345 on the Airbus A380.\n\nThis flight review video covers Zurich Airport, the Swiss Air business class lounge, boarding and the Singapore Airlines business class pod-sytle seats.  Once in your seat the famous Singapore Airlines onboard service starts with a glass of champagne followed by endless drinks and inflight meals.  When it's time for sleeping the business class seat coverts into a fully flat bed.  I also cover the entertainment system, onboard ammentities and the wonderful SilverKris Lounge at Singapore's Changi Airport.  \n\nFor more flight review videos including Emirates, Qantas, Qatar, LATAM, Turkish Airlines, Air Baltic and Cathay Pacific please visit my channel DennisBunnik Travels.  \n\nCamera:  Sony DHR-PJ790\nFlight:  SQ345\nAirline:  Singapore Airlines\nRoute:  Zurich to Singapore\nAircraft:  Airbus A380-800\nAircraft Reg: 9VSKE\nSeat:  26A (window)",

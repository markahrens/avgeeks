 "description": "Come and try Economy Class on the LATAM 787 from Sydney to Auckland on my latest flight review video. \n\nLATAM is the biggest and best airline in South America - it's the recently rebranded combination of LAN and TAM.  \n\nOn this 787 Dreamliner flight review I test out LATAM economy class.   As always my flight review features boarding, take-off, the LATAM economy class cabin and seat, the in-flight dining and LATAM's inflight entertainment system.    \n\nCheck out LATAM Business Class on the 787 here:  https://youtu.be/Z1lXjFzT8jA",

 "description": "Turkish Airlines is one of the world's fastest growing airlines with ambitions to be one of the best.  \n\nOn this video I review business class on Turkish Airlines Airbus A330 aircraft flying from Istanbul to Kiev.  \n\nThis review covers the Istanbul Lounge, boarding, the business class cabin and business class seat. Inflight meals is an area where Turkish Airlines really shines with an onboard chef who takes your orders and prepares your meals.  \n\nThe Turkish Airlines Airbus A330 business class seat converts into a lie flat bed.  \n\nThis Turkish Airlines Business Class review video also covers the inflight entertainment system as views of cloudscapes and landing from the aircraft windows.  \n\nEnjoy and happy travels.",

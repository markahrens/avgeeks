 "description": "Join me for the ultimate outback flying experience as I take off with WrightsAir from William Creek airport.  We’ll be flying over the massive Anna Creek Station – the largest cattle station in Australia and one of the largest cattle stations in the world.  This is seriously one massive farm!\n\nOur William Creek Wrightsair scenic flight takes us over Lake Eyre, the largest salt lake in Australia.  The views of the Lake Eyre Kati Thanda National Park are stunning.  Lake Eyre made world headlines when it was the site of Donald Campbell’s land speed record attempt in 1964.  Flying across Lake Eyre’s salt flats Campbell broke the world land speed record with a speed of 403miles per hour (648km per hour).\n\nFrom Lake Eyre we fly to the Painted Hills – the scenic jewel within Anna Creek Station.  Anna Creek Station is private property but bush pilot and owner of WrightsAir Trevor Wright has special permission to fly over and land within this incredible landscape.  So we did and it was an amazing experience. \n\nIf you ever have the chance visit William Creek in South Australia.  And when you do make sure you take to the skies on a Wrightsair Scenic Flight from William Creek Airport.  My strong recommendation is the flight combining Lake Eyre and the Painted Hills with the landing and walk through this incredible pristine outback environment. \n\nwww.wrightsair.com.au \n\n#wrightsair #lakeeyre #outbackflight #annacreekstation #paintedhills #williamcreek",

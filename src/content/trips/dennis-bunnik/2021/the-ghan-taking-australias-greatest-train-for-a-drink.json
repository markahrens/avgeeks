 "description": "The Ghan is an Australian icon transporting travellers in luxury the 3,000km from Adelaide to Darwin.  It’s a journey that should be on everyone’s To Do list.  \n\nToday for the first time ever we’re taking The Ghan for a little day trip as we visit the beautiful Clare Valley wine region. It’s the Taste of the Ghan and you’re invited along for the ride. \n\nJoin me as I board Australia’s greatest train the legendary Ghan at Adelaide Parklands Terminal for a day of fine wine and delicious food.  \n\nThe indulgence starts with bubbles at a pre-boarding welcome function then continues onboard the Ghan with a hearty breakfast.  Upon arrival in the Clare Valley we head straight to Pikes Winery for a private tasting of their premium wines.  This is followed by the ultimate long lunch on the veranda at O’Leary Walker Wines with stunning views over the vines. \n\nOur day ends with more wine and cheese as our private train in the form of the Ghan transports us back to Adelaide. \n\nAlso remember to check out Ifly Aviation's cool review of this trip which includes lunch at Pikes Wines: https://youtu.be/ftR6Q6Xo150 \n\n#Ghan #ClareValley #trains\n\n00:00 Hello & Welcome\n00:24 Welcome Function\n01:51 Boarding\n02:28 Breakfast\n03:34 Nantawarra Siding\n04:16 Pikes Wines Clare Valley\n06:16 O'Leary Walker Wines Clare Valley\n09:26 Going Home\n10:00 Platinum Class Cabin\n10:30 Gold Class Cabin",

 "name": "Illuminate Adelaide Festival - City Lights 2021",
 "description": "With our state borders closed to almost everybody the very first Illuminate Adelaide festival was a locals only affair.  But fear not, with the help of my camera, here's a sneak peak of what went down.  \n\nThis mid-winter festival includes a number of free events including City Lights which sees 40 buildings and art installations in the city centre all lit up for us to enjoy.  \n\nJoin me as I take to the streets of Adelaide and explore the 2021 Illuminate Adelaide festival.  \n\nEnjoy!",

 "name": "Roasted by my own sons - 50th birthday speech",
 "description": "Here's something a little different - me on the receiving end.  My sons took to the stage at my 50th birthday party to tell a few tales. \n\nI thought we had actually lost this footage forever due to a computer crash.  Very happy that we have just found it again so am posting it up here so it will be saved forever.  \n\nWhen I was their age I was so shy I couldn't talk in front of 4 people let alone almost 200. I am in absolute awe at their ability to hold a room and bounce off each other they way they did.  Very proud dad!!\n\nThe party was back in 2019. A great night with friends celebrating in a covid free world.  The party was held in the ballroom at work and was 1920's themed.  As they say, a good night was had by all.  \n\n#best50thbirthdayspeech #birthdayspeech",

 "description": "Beijing to Sydney in business class with Air China.  What's it really like?  \n\nOn this flight review I show the full Air China business class experience from the Air China business class lounge through to boarding the Boeing 777 and then the onboard Air China business class experience.  This included the inflight meals, entertainment system, the Air China business class seat which converts into a fully flat bed, the amenities provided and the views out the window.  Those views included us flying the full length of the Great Barrier Reef as we flew down the Queensland coast. \n\nThis flight was the second leg of my journey from London Heathrow to Sydney Australia with Air China.  The first leg from Heathrow to Beijing was disappointing, it was on an old A330, so I was hoping for a better experience this time. \n\nJoin me and we'll see what it was really like. \n\nHere’s the link I mentioned in the video:\n\nAir China A330 Business Class: https://youtu.be/glz3Z8U54rY\n\n\nRoute:     Beijing Capital Airport, China (PEK) to Sydney Australia (SYD)\nLength:   5,576 miles, 9:48​ hrs\nFlight:     CA173  Seat 15A\nAircraft:  Boeing 777-300ER  registration B-1282 (Aug 2018)\nWhen:    25 Nov 2019\n\nCamera:  Panasonic HC-VX1\n\n\nThis video may not be reproduced without specific permission.\n\nQ&A Video:       https://youtu.be/6VoRFtNDC04​\nThe Business Trip:   https://youtu.be/xgNXuBTyDTQ​\nThe Business Trip – IndoChina:  https://youtu.be/pkNcpk2whLU​\n\n\nFirst Class Reviews:\n\nSingapore Airlines A380 First Class Suites for 2    https://youtu.be/ITSNdSJ_MnU​\nEtihad A380 First Class Apartment:   https://youtu.be/vAl5AFzQyIo​\nEmirates 777 First Class:     https://youtu.be/hwHupTHbGVk​\nEmirates A30 First Class:     https://youtu.be/ulgxwkG87Fs​\nSingapore Airlines A380 First Class Suite:  https://youtu.be/yNoNrAXS38I​\nThai Airways 747 Royal First Class:    https://youtu.be/UkhbKJb1WiU​\nSwiss Air A340 First Class:    https://youtu.be/CuXLDEtpKzU​\nQantas A380 First Class:      https://youtu.be/Mv4kBPUqGQU​\nCathay Pacific 777 First Class:     https://youtu.be/52kIrUm3o08​\nLufthansa First Class A340:    https://youtu.be/Y6evcYcwIqU​",

 "name": "Flying the Max 8: Oman Air Flight Review",
 "description": "To tell you the truth this could also be considered a muffin review.  But then Oman never fails to surprise and delight. \n\nOn this, my continuing series on Oman Air, I fly the Boeing 737 Max 8 from Muscat down to Salalah in the south of Oman. \n\nMy review includes the beautiful airport in Muscat that Oman Air calls home. It's here that I'm tempted by that muffin and blown away by some cashews. \n\nWe then jump onboard the Max 8 for our 90 minute flight Muscat to Salalah. As always my flight review covers the entire experience including the take off, landing, seat, Oman Air inflight entertainment and the meal service on board. \n\nAs a bonus extra I've also included some footage of my travels through Oman - an amazing country that you should definitely put on your list to visit. \n\nI hope you enjoy this Oman Air 737 Max 8 flight review. Let me know in the comments below. \n\nHere's the link to my Oman Air 787 Business Class Review: https://youtu.be/Gjylx6B1WXo \n\nHappy travels\n\nDennis\n\n#omanair #737max8 #flight",

 "description": "From the outside Asiana Airlines aircraft look stunning with a super cool livery...on the inside it's a different story.  The colour scheme and the seat design give the cabin a definite retro-vibe. \n\nBut what was the rest of the experience like?  Join me as I fly from Seoul, South Korea through to Sydney Australia and we'll find out together. \n\nThis will be a 9 Hour Retro Feast in Asiana Business Class. \n\nThis full business class flight review covers the entire Asiana Business Class experience from check in at Seoul Railway Station right through to the Asiana airport lounge, the onboard service, amenities kits and meals. \n\n#asianaairlines #businessclass #flightreview",

 "description": "I've been a Qantas Platinum Frequent Flyer for about 15 years and pre-covid would average 40-50 flights a year with them. At the end of September this year my membership year rolls over so by then I need to earn enough Status Credits by flying Qantas to ensure I retain Platinum. Every year retaining Platinum was always my first priority when working out what flights to book. \n\nHowever, this year, for the first time ever, I have no real motivation or desire to even try to requalify for Platinum status.  \n\nSadly I know I’m not the only one feeling this way and it shows the huge underlying problem Qantas is facing as it’s once loyal customers turn their back on what was a great airline. \n\nBut what’s the alternative? Can Virgin Australia really compete? Is Qanta’s Pain really Virgin’s Gain? Is it time to swap sides?\n\nWatch this video and let’s find out.  On a recent regular trip from Adelaide to Sydney I flew Virgin Australia to see how they compare. In doing so I know I made reattaining Qantas Platinum even harder for myself. But I did save $300 on the return trip so the decision was a no brainer. \n\nThis Virgin Australia flight review covers my Boeing 737 flight from Sydney to Adelaide in economy class. It’s a standard business route flown by both business and leisure travellers day in day out. It competes directly with Qantas flying the same aircraft type so the perfect opportunity to see how they compare. \n\nThanks for taking the time to watch this video. If you liked it please subscribe and check out my channel where my back catalogue includes flights all over the world in economy through to first class suites.  There’s a lot more on the way too. \n\nHappy travels\n\nDennis\n\n#Qantas #Virgin #flightreview",

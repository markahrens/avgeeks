 "description": "You have to fly this airline!  Oman Air 787 Business Class\n\nOman Air is not airline I knew much about nor had I flown them before.  But this one flight from Bangkok to Muscat on their flagship 787 in business class has me hooked!  I'll definitely be flying them again.  Why? Because Oman Air has the best business class seat and bed in the sky. They offer dining on demand and their crew are really really good. \n\nDon't believe me? Watch this Oman Air flight review to find out exactly why I like them so much - and also what I really didn't like about Oman Air. \n\nThis Oman Air business class review covers my entire journey with Oman Air from Bangkok to Muscat in the Boeing 787. This includes the Oman Air business class lounge at Bangkok airport, boarding, take off and the incredible inflight service from Oman Air.   \n\nIf you're new to my channel, welcome aboard and thanks for watching.

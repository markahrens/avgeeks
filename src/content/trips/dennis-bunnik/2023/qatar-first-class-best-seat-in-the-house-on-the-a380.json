 "description": "Ever wondered what first class on the Qatar A380 is like?  Join me and let’s find out together as I fly from Sydney Australian to Doha in First Class on Qatar Airways. \n\nQatar Airways have a well-founded reputation as offering the best business class in the sky.  They even boast that their Q-Suite is First in Business. \n\nSo does Qatar Airways even need a First Class? And is Qatar First Class worth the extra cost considering Qatar Business Class is so good?\n\nWith these questions in mind I didn’t hesitate when given the chance to upgrade from Business to First when checking-in on a recent Qatar flight on the A380.  Especially as this was a 14 hour flight – the perfect opportunity to really check out Qatar’s First Class and compare it to my recent flight on Air France La Premiere. \n\nThe other reason I wanted to try it is because Qatar only offers real first class on one aircraft type – the iconic double decker Airbus A380, the world’s biggest passenger aircraft.  Qatar First Class is therefore not only exclusive but it is also elusive with only 10 A380s in their fleet.  \n\nJoin me as I travel in the lap of luxury from Sydney to Doha in the Best Seat in the House – 1A.  \n\nQatar First Class review.  \nFlight  QR909\nRoute: SYD-DIA Sydney to Doha\nDate: November 2023\n\n#qatarfirstclass #qatarflightreview #luxurytravel\n\n\n\n00:00 Introduction\n02:06 Air New Zealand Lounge\n02:59 Boarding\n04:18 Cheers!

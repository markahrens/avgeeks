 "description": "Why I love Malaysia Airlines Business Class.  It can be summed up in one word and one dish - Satays!\n\nThis was my first Malaysia Airlines flight since the pandemic and I was keen to see if they were still the same good old reliable Malaysia Airlines as they have always been - offering great value business class with friendly personalised service.  And of course I wanted to reconnect with my favourite dish in the sky - Malaysia Airlines iconic satay service.  \n\nMalaysia Airlines has been serving satays in business class for as long as I remember and whilst other airlines may try to copy none of them have ever come close to the deliciousness of the Malaysia Airlines Satay!\n\nThis Malaysia Airlines business class review is a full flight review of the entire Malaysia Airlines premium experience from the lounge right through to the onboard experience. \n\nJoin me and we'll do it together. \n\nHere's the link to that Oman Airlines business class I refer to in the video:  https://youtu.be/81-LvL1Hmd4\n\nHappy Travels\n\n#malaysiaairlines #businessclass #flightreview",

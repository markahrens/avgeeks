 "description": "This is the story of Qatar Airways secret crew terminal. How Airlines Work Part 2\n\nHave you ever noticed that you don’t see any Qatar Airways pilots or cabin crew walking through Hamad International Airport in Doha? \n\nSo where do they check in and how do they get to their aircraft?\n\nI’ve been given exclusive behind the scenes access at Qatar Airways to answer this and many more questions. In this episode I’ll take you behind the scenes at Qatar’s dedicated crew terminal.  This is where the flight and cabin crew check-in, get their pre-flight briefing and then get their own private transfer straight to the aircraft. \n\nI’ll also show you how the arrival process works.  This starts with a dedicated set of stairs at the back of the aircraft for crew to disembark to their own private bus.  Upon arrival at Qatar Airways secret crew terminal they go through immigration and security just like the rest of us. The private crew terminal even has its own Duty Free store and luggage belts. \n\nThis is the second video in my series How Airlines Work. Make sure you subscribe and hit that notification bell so you’ll be the first to know when I release my next video. \n\nAlso check out Episode 1: What Really Happens to Inflight Blankets!:  https://youtu.be/pZesw5CFdq8\n\nThanks for watching and, as always, happy travels! \n\n#QatarAirways #behindthescenes #HowAirlinesWork",

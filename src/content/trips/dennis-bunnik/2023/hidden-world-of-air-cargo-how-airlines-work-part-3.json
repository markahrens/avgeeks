 "description": "Let's look at the Hidden World of Air Cargo.  This is Part 3 of in my continuing behind the scenes series at Qatar Airways.\n\nFreight, or air cargo, plays a vital role in the commercial success of an airline. It also helps keep the world supplied.  However air cargo is a side of the airline industry that is rarely seen by the general public.  I therefore jumped at the opportunity to go behind the scenes at Qatar Air Cargo. \n\nFrom family pets to jet engines and everything in between there is almost no limit to what can be transported by air.  The numbers are simply staggering and in this exclusive look into the Hidden World of Air Cargo we find out just what makes Qatar Air Cargo tick. \n\nHere are the links to the rest of the Qatar Behind the Scenes Series:\n\nPart 1: What Really Happens to Inflight Blankets:  https://youtu.be/pZesw5CFdq8\nPart 2: Qatar's Secret Crew Terminal:  https://youtu.be/vXb4QUWyAGE\n\nHappy Travels\n\nDennis\n\n#aircargo #behindthescenes #qatarairways",

 "description": "Welcome to the world of Polaris – United Airlines’ take on Business Class.\n\nThe question: is it any good?  Well, there’s no better way to find out than to take a super long haul flight – from Australia all the way across the Pacific to the USA. \n\nJoin me as I spend 13 hours onboard a United 787 and enjoy all the travel comforts that Polaris has to offer. \n\nThis United Airlines Flight Review did not get off to the best start. A couple of delays saw us take off over 2 hours late. But that’s life. \n\nOnce in the air I got to take full advantage of the United Polaris seat and the uniquely branded Polaris business class product. \n\nFrom the meals to the crew, the amenities kit to the PJs this United business class flight review covers the entire experience. \n\nJoin me, let’s fly to LA. \n\n#United #Polaris #flightreview",

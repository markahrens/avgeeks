 "description": "I have to admit, Asiana Airlines is not an airline I know a lot about.  \n\nI know they have a great livery and are a full service airline from South Korea but are they any good?  Join me and we'll find out together.\n\nWe're flying on an Asiana 777 in economy class from Sydney Australia to Seoul South Korea with a flight time of just under 10 hours. The perfect chance to test out if Asiana is any good and if it should be on your list of airlines to fly.  \n\nWe boarded and pushed back on time. Unfortunately though the pilots discovered a technical fault as we taxied to the runway and had to return to the gate.  A 90 minute delay with minimal information provided was not the ideal start for Asiana. \n\nHowever once the problem was fixed and we took off I got to enjoy the Asiana Airline hospitality in full.  Their crew were lovely, the food - even in economy - was delicious and the seat was very comfortable.  \n\nThe Asiana economy class flight review covers the entire experience including the onboard service, inflight entertainment system, take off and landing. \n\nIs it any good? Asiana Airlines Economy Class Review. \n\nNow here is the link to my great mate Jeb Brooks' video he made whilst in Australia travelling on the iconic Ghan railway from Adelaide to Darwin:  https://youtu.be/gNmhrTOYcqg\n\n#asianaairlines #flightreview #economyclass",

  "name": "United Airlines Polaris to London - Eat BEFORE You Board!",
  "description": "I had always thought that airlines offer their very best product on their flagship international routes.  And for United it doesn't get much more flagship than their Newark to Heathrow route with 7 daily flights. \n\nSadly, compared to my recent excellent Polaris experience from Sydney to LAX, this flight was a disappointment with United appearing to take it very much for granted.  My advice when it comes to United Airlines Polaris to London is Eat Before You Board!\n\nJoin me as I take you through the full United Airlines business class experience from the massive United Polaris Lounge at Newark, through the entire onboard experience of dining, seating, entertainment and sleeping to our arrival at London Heathrow.  And it's here in London where you actually get to experience the best bit about United's service between the US and London - it's arrivals lounge at Heathrow. \n\nIf you've flown United Polaris let me know what you thought and if you haven't, would you fly it based on this video?\n\nThanks for watching and, as always, happy travels!\n\nDennis\n\n#unitedairlines #unitedpolaris #luxurytravel \n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:40 Polaris Lounge Newark\n01:19 Boarding\n01:51 Cheers!\n02:32 Cabin & Seat Features\n03:57 Drink Service & Menus\n04:29 Dinner Service\n05:03 Amenities Kit\n05:23 Bed Mode\n05:46 Entertainment System\n06:11 Descent into London\n06:46 United Arrivals Lounge Heathrow",

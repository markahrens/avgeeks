 "description": "Just want to let you all know that we, and all the other passengers, are okay and now (unexpectedly) overnighting in Melbourne. \n\nI was on UL605 this afternoon (12 Feb) when 30 minutes after our departure we had to return to Melbourne where we made an emergency landing. \n\nChannel 9 News approached me in the terminal for an interview. \n\nI was filming a flight review onboard and hope to continue that when we recommence our journey tomorrow. The full flight review including what happened and how Sri Lankan Airlines handled it will be up on my channel in a few days. \n\n#srilankanairline #emergencylanding",

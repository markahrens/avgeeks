 "name": "REX Business Class - Are They Up To It?",
 "description": "Over the past few years Regional Express, or REX, has been transforming itself from purely a regional carrier to a serious competitor to Virgin and Qantas on mainline routes between capital cities. \n\nBut what are they like and are they suitable for the business traveller? Watch this video and we'll find out together. \n\nREX Business Class - Are They Up To It?\n\nThis REX business class flight review was filmed on my flight from Adelaide to Melbourne on a REX 737.  My upgrade from economy class to business class was due to a successful upgrade bid of $85.  \n\nThe REX Business Class experience starts at the airport with priority check-in and luggage followed by access to the REX business class lounge. \n\nThe REX ground staff in Adelaide were wonderful - helpful and friendly!  They even let me board a little early so I could film the cabin without passengers. \n\nThe excellent service continued onboard as we flew REX business class to Melbourne.  \n\nI hope you enjoy the video and if you have not done so please consider subscribing to my channel and checking out my other videos. \n\nHappy travels \n\nDennis\n\n#RegionalExpress #REX #aviation",

 "description": "You know an airline takes food seriously when they have a chef on board every long haul flight to specifically look after their business class passengers. \n\nIt's time to road test Turkish Airlines business class on a long haul flight from Istanbul to Singapore and see if they live up to their reputation. \n\nAnybody who has been to Turkey will tell you about the wonderful Turkish hospitality and food.  But what is their national airline - Turkish Airlines - like? \n\nTurkish Airlines say they fly to more countries than any other airline and have just announced they will finally commence flying to Australia in Q1 2024.  This is massive news for Australian travellers as the Turkish Airlines route network, especially in Eastern Europe, is unrivalled.  \n\nSo does the Turkish Airlines Business Class live up to the hype?  Watch this Turkish Airlines Flight Review and find out.  This flight review covers 2 flights - first my hop from Ljubljana to Istanbul in Turkish Airlines wonderful European business class.  Then I jump onboard a TK Boeing 787 for the long haul flight to Singapore.

  "description": "I wasn't even supposed to be on this flight but I'm so glad I was because it turns out I won the Malaysian Airlines lottery. \n\nYou see on the outside this A350 looks very Malaysian but on the inside it has a distinctly Scandinavian feel.  Why?  Watch the video and I'll explain all and even explain how an emergency landing led to me being on this flight in the first place and capturing a stunning avgeek view of Qantas' most famous new aircraft. \n\nThis is Malaysian Airlines Business Class But Better.  Malaysian Business class on the A350 from Melbourne Australia to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.  Join me and I'll show you the wonderful Malaysian Business class hospitality as we fly across Australia.  I'll also show you why you'll want to fly in special ex-SAS Scandinavian Airlines aircraft and how you can find out where it's flying. \n\n#malaysianairlines #businessclass #flightreview \n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:49 The Storm\n02:05 Seats & Cabin\n03:27 Drink From the Bar\n03:38 Satay Time & Lunch\n04:41 Route Map & Window Views\n05:10 Inflight Entertainment System\n05:31 Amenities\n05:45 Loo Review\n06:26 Bed Mode\n07:46 Work & Sunset Views\n08:24 How to Win the MH Lottery",

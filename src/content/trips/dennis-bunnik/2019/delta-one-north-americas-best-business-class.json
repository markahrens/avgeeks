 "name": "Delta One - North America's Best Business Class!",
 "description": "The North American legacy airlines have never had the best reputation.  However, over the last few years all have them have upped their game – especially in international business class.  I’ve flown all the others but never Detla – until now.  And it turns out I left the best till last.   This Delta One experience was brilliant!  \n\nBefore I get into the review here’s some links I referred to in my video:\n\nJeb Brook’s Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsQLTECz1bCA56JIryaw-lA\nJeb & Dennis do a Q&A:  https://youtu.be/7DobmtqxFyY \n\nAnd if you get the chance do check out the Small Group Touring Co – we run some really nice small group tours to some of the word’s most beautiful and iconic destinations.  Here’s the link:  https://smallgrouptouringco.com \n\n\nSo this Delta One flight review covers the entire Delta One Business Class experience from check in at Detroit Airport through to the Lounge, boarding, take off and the wonderful Delta inflight service.  I also cover all the features of Delta’s pod style suites – each with their own door which can be closed for total privacy.  \n\nJoin me and we’ll experience it together.  \n\nRoute:     Detroit (DTW) to Amsterdam (AMS)\nLength:   3,934 miles, 6:58 hrs\nFlight:     DL132   Seat 7A\nAircraft:  Airbus A350-900  registration N508DN (Jan 2018) \nWhen:    15 July 2019\n\nCamera:  Panasonic HC-VX1\n\n\nThis video may not be reproduced without specific permission.\n\nQ&A Video:       https://youtu.be/6VoRFtNDC04\nThe Business Trip:   https://youtu.be/xgNXuBTyDTQ\nThe Business Trip – IndoChina:  https://youtu.be/pkNcpk2whLU\n\n\nFirst Class Reviews:\n\nSingapore Airlines A380 First Class Suites for 2    https://youtu.be/ITSNdSJ_MnU\nEtihad A380 First Class Apartment:   https://youtu.be/vAl5AFzQyIo\nEmirates 777 First Class:     https://youtu.be/hwHupTHbGVk\nEmirates A30 First Class:     https://youtu.be/ulgxwkG87Fs\nSingapore Airlines A380 First Class Suite:  https://youtu.be/yNoNrAXS38I\nThai Airways 747 Royal First Class:    https://youtu.be/UkhbKJb1WiU\nSwiss Air A340 First Class:    https://youtu.be/CuXLDEtpKzU\nQantas A380 First Class:      https://youtu.be/Mv4kBPUqGQU\nCathay Pacific 777 First Class:     https://youtu.be/52kIrUm3o08\nLufthansa First Class A340:    https://youtu.be/Y6evcYcwIqU",

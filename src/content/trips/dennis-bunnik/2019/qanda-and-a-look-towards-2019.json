Along the way I have been overwhelmed by the encouragement and positive messaged from the YouTube and aviation world.  I have also received many questions - this video tries to answer as many of those as possible. \n\nThank you too everybody who has watched, liked and commented on my videos - your support is greatly appreciated and is very humbling.\n\nHappy travels and a safe, happy and healthy 2019 to all. \n\nCheers\n\nDennis\n\nPs here are the links to our companies:\n\nhttps://www.bunniktours.com.au/\nhttps://www.smallgrouptouringco.com\nhttps://smallgrouptouringco.com/au",

 "description": "It’s time to fly!  This time I’m checking out Premium Economy on the world’s largest passenger aircraft – the massive Airbus A380.\n\nI’m flying with Qantas from Melbourne to Singapore on QF35 – the perfect 7 ½ hour flight to check out the full Qantas Premium Economy service and see if it is worth the upgrade from standard economy class.  \n\nThis Qantas flight review features the entire Qantas premium economy product from departure through take off, the onboard service, the seat, entertainment system and our landing in Singapore.  \n\nJoin me and we’ll experience the Qantas A380 together. \n\nNOTE:  Qantas has 12 Airbus A380s in their fleet – they are currently upgrading these so that the premium economy and business class seats are the same standard as those featured on the Qantas 787.  At the time of uploading only one aircraft had been done and another one (this one I flew) was being done.  It will take until the end of at least 2020 until all 12 aircraft are upgraded.  \n\nHere are some links referred to in my video:\n\nQantas 787 Business Class (London to Perth): https://youtu.be/nMllaCgDj8w\nChina Eastern 787 Business Class:  https://youtu.be/XoWYkzaQK4I\n\n\nRoute:     Melbourne (MEL) to Singapore (SIN)\nLength:   3,754 miles, 7:32 hrs\nFlight:     QF35   Seat 24A\nAircraft:  Airbus A380-800  registration VH-OQH (Aug 2009) \nWhen:    14 August 2019\n\nCamera:  Panasonic HC-VX1\n\n\nThis video may not be reproduced without specific permission.\n\nQ&A Video:       https://youtu.be/6VoRFtNDC04\nThe Business Trip:   https://youtu.be/xgNXuBTyDTQ\nThe Business Trip – IndoChina:  https://youtu.be/pkNcpk2whLU\n\n\nFirst Class Reviews:\n\nSingapore Airlines A380 First Class Suites for 2    https://youtu.be/ITSNdSJ_MnU\nEtihad A380 First Class Apartment:   https://youtu.be/vAl5AFzQyIo\nEmirates 777 First Class:     https://youtu.be/hwHupTHbGVk\nEmirates A30 First Class:     https://youtu.be/ulgxwkG87Fs\nSingapore Airlines A380 First Class Suite:  https://youtu.be/yNoNrAXS38I\nThai Airways 747 Royal First Class:    https://youtu.be/UkhbKJb1WiU\nSwiss Air A340 First Class:    https://youtu.be/CuXLDEtpKzU\nQantas A380 First Class:      https://youtu.be/Mv4kBPUqGQU\nCathay Pacific 777 First Class:     https://youtu.be/52kIrUm3o08\nLufthansa First Class A340:    https://youtu.be/Y6evcYcwIqU",

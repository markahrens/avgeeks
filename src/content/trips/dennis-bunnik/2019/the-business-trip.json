 "description": "Three Days, Three Flights, Two Cities.  Welcome to my world. \n\nWhilst most of my YouTube flight reviews are on international trips flying in business class the reality is that over half my flights every year are on road warrior trips within Australia - flying from Adelaide to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.  \n\nThere's nothing glamorous about these trips but they play an important part in our business success.   So this time I thought I'd invite you along.\n\nHere are the weblinks to our touring businesses:\n\nBunnik Tours:  https://www.bunniktours.com.au/ \nThe Small Group Touring Co:  https://smallgrouptouringco.com\n\nEnjoy, and as always, happy travels!\n\ncheers\n\nDennis\n\np.s.:  at the end of this video I also have some very exciting 'Just Booked' information.  \np.s.s.:  if you're new here please take a moment to check out my channel and subscribe - lots of interesting flight reviews up there and more on the way.",

This flight was between Cairo and Paris - only 4.5 hours but plenty of time to check out the Air France Business Class product.  Being a new aircraft the Boeing 787 features the flagship Air France Business Class seat.  \n\nThis business class flight review covers check-in, the Saudi Business Class lounge at Cairo Airport, boarding, take-off, the Air France in-flight service, the amenities provided and the business class seat which converts into a lay flat bed.  \n\nThis flight was filmed on AF 567 from Cairo to Paris.  See below for more details.   \n\nFor more videos check out my channel where you'll find a range of airline reviews in economy, business and first class including Emirates, British Airways, Etihad, Qatar, Qantas, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, LATAM, Baltic Air, Turkish Airlines and more\n\nRoute:    Cairo (CAI) to Paris (CDG)\nLength:  1,998miles, 4:35 hrs\nFlight:     AF567\nWhen:    November 2017\nAircraft:  Boeing 787-9   registration F-HRBC\nSeat:       7K\nCamera:  Sony FDR-AXP55\n\n\nThis video is sponsored by Squarespace however I retain total editorial control and all opinions are my own.  \n\nThis video may not be reproduced without specific permission.",

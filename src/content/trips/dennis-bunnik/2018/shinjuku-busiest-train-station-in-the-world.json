 "description": "I've always been fascinated by how big city logistics work and seeing the movement of large masses of people.  This video shows just one platform at one Tokyo train station for 4 and a half minutes.    Just for the fun of it I've also shown the footage sped up at 8 times the normal speed at the end of the video.  \n\nNot my normal type of video upload  but I thought you might enjoy it.  Normal flight reviews will resume shortly.",

 "description": "In full disclosure, I'm a huge Delta Air Lines fan.\n\nEarlier this week, I participated in an amazing celebration to \"retire\" Delta's N669US on the final domestic run for a Delta 747. Join me for this incredible (and sad) journey from LAX to DTW.\n\nCheck out SpeedbirdHD's channel. It's awesome! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP0SSw5k85FzNjvGXIS6NAQ",

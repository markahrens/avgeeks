 "name": "When Will We Travel Again - Frequent Flyer Survey - May 2020",
 "description": "I recently published a survey out to subscribers here on YouTube, followers on Twitter (@JebBrooks) and Instagram (@JebBrooksFlies). These people represent frequent flyers and in this video I’ll share some of the results of that survey.\n\nAs a disclosure, I’m not a data scientist, survey expert, or statistician, but I still think there’s some interesting data here worth sharing.\n\nIf you’d like me to conduct the survey again in the coming weeks to see how attitudes have shifted, please let me know in the comments. Also, if you have ideas about what to ask in the next round of this survey, I’d appreciate that input, too!\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nHere's a link to the \"World Famous Island Hopper Video!\"\nhttps://youtu.be/r1cON15Av1M\n\nAnd to the unedited take-off and landing footage from that flight:\nhttps://youtu.be/1v-rGMptWcY\n\nMusic:\nDeep and Abiding (Instrumental Version) – Dayon\nRemember (Instrumental Version) - Dayon",

In this video, I'll share what it's like to travel like a pilot as I explore a long haul pilot schedule by joining a United Airlines crew on their journey from Newark to Munich and back. A good friend of mine is a 757 / 767 pilot for United and I took the opportunity to join him on his long haul pilot schedule to Munich to pick up my girlfriend…and the channel’s creative director.\n\nIf you watch this video, you’ll see what it’s like to travel like a pilot and experience a long haul pilot schedule while I travel to Europe for 24 hours and still be standing at the end of the journey! I was pretty tired, but it was an eye-opening experience.\n\nAfter this weekend where I traveled like a pilot on a long haul pilot schedule, I developed a new level of respect for pilots and flight attendants who maintain this kind of long haul schedule. Can you believe they regularly head overseas for only 24 hours at a time?! Such an intense experience - traveling like a pilot on a long haul pilot schedule!\n\nA long haul pilot schedule is challenging, but the opportunity to see how hard these professionals work was certainly worth it!\n\nSponsorship Policy: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/sponsorship-policy/\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://jebbrooksflies.com\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic: \nNights Full of Overthinking – Lionel Quick\nTides and Drift – Joseph Beg\nLike Cold November Rain – Lionel Quick\nDiving with My Harpoon – Franz Gordon\nNearly There - Headlund",

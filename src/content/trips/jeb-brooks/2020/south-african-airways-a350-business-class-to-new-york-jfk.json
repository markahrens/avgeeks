 "description": "I am not traveling now and encourage you to do the same. Please #StayHome. Here's a video with my thoughts on the current travel situation: \nhttp://jeb.flights/travel\n\nThis trip on South African Airways A350 in Business Class occurred on February 20, 2020, before the current travel restrictions went into place. Also, in the time since I traveled, South African Airways has allegedly begun discussions to lay off all of its staff. It looks like South African Airways may have flown its final flight. I hope that’s not true.\n\nAt the time I flew, South African Airways operated four A350’s. Two originally from Hainan Airlines and two from Air Mauritius. \n\nIn this video, I’ll share the trip in the South African Airways A350 from Cape Town to Johannesburg and the longer flight on to New York.\n\nWe’ll explore the seat, the food, the service, and the overall experience of flying in Business Class with South African Airways in their A350.\n\nHere’s a link to the unedited take-off and landing footage: \nhttps://youtu.be/HrQSjhdtMak\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nFollow me on Instagram:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic: \nWhisper of the Pines – Howard Harper-Barnes\nA Place for Us – Howard Harper-Barnes\nEnd of the Beginning – Fabien Tell\nTry Try Try – Airae\nA Deeper Sleep – Ecobel\nBarefoot (Instrumental Version) – Slowfly",

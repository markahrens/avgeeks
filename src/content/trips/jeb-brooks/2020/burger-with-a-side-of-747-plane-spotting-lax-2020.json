 "description": "When you think about seeing the action at LAX, there's only one planespotting location that comes to mind: The In-N-Out Burger at 9149 S Sepulveda Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90045. In this video, I'll share some of the planes I spotted while I was there one Saturday morning in January. \n\nIt was a fun few hours and culminated in a killer cheeseburger from the In-N-Out Burger LAX. \n\nSponsorship Policy: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/sponsors\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://jebbrooksflies.com\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nNostalgico - Catiso\nHappy Days - Dez Moran",

 "description": "Scandinavian Airlines recently launched a brand new airplane. The Scandinavian Airlines A350 represents some of the best the company has to offer. In this video, we'll explore the Copenhagen Airport, the Scandinavian Airlines A350 in Business Class and Economy, as well as all of the celebrations that accompanied the excitement surrounding the first day the Scandinavian Airlines A350 took to the skies. \n\nAs an aviation enthusiast, I'm not sure I enjoy anything quite as much as an inaugural flight and to have the chance to be one of the first to fly on Scandinavian Airlines' A350 was even more special since I had almost no experience with Scandinavian Airlines before this.\n\nFull Take-off and landing footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/uK_7idJrKbA\n\nSponsorship Policy:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/sponsors\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://jebbrooksflies.com\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic: \nRoscoe's Dream - Philip Ayers\nHighlands - Philip Ayers\nFirst Flakes - Philip Ayers\nThis is Not It - Philip Ayers\nNew Age Solitude - Philip Ayers\nOnce Upon a Lifetime - Philip Ayers\nOminous - Philip Ayers\nHong Kong Calling - Philip Ayers\nPlease Hear Me Out - Philip Ayers",

 "description": "In this video, you’ll see what it’s like to fly from Alaska to Hawaii.\n\nThis unusual air link has only been around since 2007 when Alaska Airlines started serving Honolulu from Anchorage.\n\nThis journey, which was part of our #WildernessToWaikiki adventure involved a First Class trip between the largest cities in the two newest states: Anchorage in Alaska and Honolulu in Hawaii. The flight from Alaska to Hawaii takes six hours, crosses through two time zones, and covers nearly 2,800 miles.\n\nIn this video about Alaska Airlines’ service from Alaska to Hawaii, you’ll see the lounge, food, drinks, inflight entertainment, and seat available to passengers plying the Pacific between the Last Frontier and Paradise!\n\nWatch to the end for a rare “GreenerGrass Editorial” in which I share my views on the current “State of Travel,” for what they’re worth. \n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:16 Hawaii Entry Requirements\n3:10 Alaska Airlines Anchorage Lounge\n4:50 Alaska to Hawaii Boarding\n9:41 Alaska Airlines Inflight Entertainment\n12:43 Alaska Airlines 737-800 Cabin Walkthrough\n14:07 GreenerGrass Editorial\n\nHere’s episode one of the #WildernessToWaikiki Trip!

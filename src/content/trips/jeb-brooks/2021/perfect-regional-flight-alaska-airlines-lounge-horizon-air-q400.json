 "description": "Horizon Air is Alaska Airlines’ Regional Partner. \n\nIn this video, I’ll explore Alaska Airlines newest lounge. A 15,800 square foot palace to traveling pleasure located in the North Satellite. It’s got everything a frequent traveler may desire. See it for yourself, but trust me when I say…it may be North America’s best airline lounge!\n\nFrom there, you’ll see my experience onboard a Horizon Air Dash 8, which is also known as a Bombardier Q400. Horizon Air’s Q400 is a spectacular regional airplane that’s perfect for the missions this Seattle-based carrier requires.\n\nYou’ll see the Horizon Air Q400 seats, the Horizon Air service, and the Horizon Air Food. But, best of all, you’ll see some of the best views the United States has to offer.

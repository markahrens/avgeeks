 "description": "Cape Air is one of America’s most interesting airlines. And on this Cape Air flight, we flew from Boston to Bar Harbor in a Cessna 420. The nine-passenger airplane is perfect for the mission Cape Air gives it, flying short connections between major cities and smaller, more rural outposts. \n\nIn this video, you'll see what it's on a Cape Air Flight and understand what makes Cape Air so special. \n\nYou'll see the seats, the (lack of) inflight entertainment, and the spectacular views along the New England coastline. \n\n0:00 Introduction \n1:57 Checking into Cape Air \n4:37 Boarding Cape Air \n5:35 Cape Air Takeoff \n7:22 Cape Air Route Network \n9:05 Cape Air Landing \n\nHere’s a link to Cape Air’s Baggage Information:\nhttps://www.capeair.com/flying_with_us/baggage.html\n\nHere’s a link to a playlist of other videos about propeller-driven airplanes:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFepjHkKYKza7ID1dvJJQ3KiL\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic: \nAutumn Haze - West & Zander\n Froot Loops - Jobii \nforeverlasting - Justnormal \nFlightmode - Chris Shards \nRaw Vibes - FLYIN \nFredagsmys K2 - Henyao",

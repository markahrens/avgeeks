 "name": "North Carolina by Rail: Amtrak Carolinian and Piedmont Trains",
 "description": "NC by Rail is an innovative program based on the incredible network of Amtrak Trains available within the heart of my home state of North Carolina!\n\nMy home state of NC, through the North Carolina Department of Transportation, has had a nearly four decades long partnership with Amtrak to do just that for its citizens. \n\nIn this video, I'll share the Amtrak Carolinian and the Piedmont, which is owned by the State of North Carolina, but operated (mostly) by Amtrak employees!\n\nFirst, we'll leave Greensboro, NC onboard the Amtrak Carolinian, in Amtrak's Business Class and travel four stops before getting out at the Raleigh, North Carolina Train Station. We'll explore a little of Raleigh before heading back to Raleigh's (strangely named) Union Station and hopping onboard my favorite Train so far - The Amtrak Piedmont Train!\n\nAlong the way, you'll see several North Carolina Amtrak Train Stations as well as a lot of what makes North Carolina such a beautiful place!\n\nHere's the unedited footage of arrivals and departures I used in the video:\nhttps://youtu.be/Ugu1AfjvKmA\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:18 Boarding the Amtrak Carolinian\n7:08 Arriving in Raleigh on the the Amtrak Carolinian\n8:52 Departing on the Piedmont Train\n14:48 Arriving in Greensboro on the Piedmont Train\n\nDon’t miss my video about Amtrak’s Empire Builder:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYhuB2uzN9k\n\nAnd here’s a link to the video we made about Amtrak’s Southwest Chief:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYiMihP0OHU\n\nHere's one I made about the California Zephyr:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gRPEZdKyI\n\nHere's a video I made comparing Amtrak's Acela to a plane:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVLnQFTazz8\n\nAnd, while we’re at it, here’s a playlist of all of the train videos on my channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFepS_ZVMUVMsf43z3FYjn4cc\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nTrain Hoppin' - Martin Klem\nBryant Park - Dylan Sitts\nSo Casual - Tigerblood Jewel\nSpin Doctor - Scoobadive\nA Minute Too Early - Arc De Soleil\nBocosaurus - Arc De Soleil\nMarappa - Arc De Soleil\nPomPom Volcano - Arc De Soleil",

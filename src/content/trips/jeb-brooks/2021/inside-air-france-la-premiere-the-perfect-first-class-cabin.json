Air France First Class service is a step above just about anything you can experience in the sky with any other airline.\n\nWatch this video to decide for yourself whether a flight like this should be on your list!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:05 Departing Athens with Air France\n3:53 Air France La Premiere First Class Lounge\n6:18 Boarding Air France 777-300\n8:14 Departure\n8:54 Settling into Air France La Premiere First Class\n10:21 Air France La Premiere Lunch\n11:19 Air France 777-300 Cabin Tour\n12:47 Air France La Premiere First Class Jebscore\n\nAir France La Premiere A380 Flight (My First Trip Report!)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRGqOtP0E4U\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nPrepare for Take-Off – Phoenix Tail\nCome Morning – Boil The Ocean\nFriends for Life – Indigo Days\nMagnetic – Boil The Ocean\nTemporary Solution – Infinity Ripple\nCut and Run – Airae\nFalse Longing – Jon Bjork\nReconcile – Peter Sandberg\nMagnetic – Boil The Ocean",

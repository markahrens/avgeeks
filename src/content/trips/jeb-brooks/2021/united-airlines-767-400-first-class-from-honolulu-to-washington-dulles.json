 "description": "In this video, you’ll see United Airlines’ First Class Hawaii service on a nine hour flight from Honolulu to the East Coast of the United States.\n\nAt nearly 5,000 miles, this United Airlines 767-400 flight is nearly as long as a flight from Washington to Moscow. It crosses six time zones and we’ll fly at an altitude of 35,000 feet.\n\nYou’ll see United Airlines’ lounge in Honolulu as well as the seat, food, and service available to First Class passengers on this long-haul domestic route. You’ll even see the Inflight Entertainment system on a United Airlines Boeing 767-400.\n\nPerhaps best of all, you’ll get a stunning view of Diamondhead as we depart Oahu and some pretty spectacular views of the sunset over the Pacific Ocean.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:50 Checking in for United Airlines\n3:17 United Airlines Lounge in Honolulu\n6:12 United Airlines Delay\n7:20 Boarding United Airlines First Class\n10:15 Departing Oahu\n11:24 United First Class Dinner\n13:34 JebScore\n\nHere’s episode one of the #WildernessToWaikiki Trip!

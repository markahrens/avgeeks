 "description": "Each Saturday over the next several weeks, I’ll publish a new video highlighting another aspect of some of the most epic traveling ever to appear on this channel. In this short video, you’ll get you a preview of what’s to come!\n\nWe flew with Qatar to Kenya experiencing their industry-leading Q Suites, Business class so good, they say, you don’t need First Class.\n\nWe then went out to the Masai Mara with Air Kenya and encountered just about every African animal you can imagine.\n\nFrom there, we traveled with Kenya Airways to the Seychelles where we took in the unmatched beaches and watched giant bats with four-foot wingspans.\n\nFrom there, we traveled to Cairo in something Qatar calls First Class. \n\nIn Egypt we tried out EgytAir’s A220’s as we traveled domestically. \n\nWhile experiencing the magic of Egypt, our planned return flight to Dulles was cancelled and, after a last-minute scramble, we booked Emirates on not one, but two A380’s in First Class!\n\nAll this and more coming soon!\n\nThumbnail Photo by Ryan Patterson, \"DieCastRyan\" on Instagram!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:22 Preview\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nWe Can Only Overcome - Sahara Skylight\nSummer Night (Instrumental Version - Wai",

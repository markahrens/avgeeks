 "description": "Watch this video to see how “First Class” you can make Spirit Airlines using some Spirit Airlines hacks. \n\nSpirit Airlines is known far and wide as an ultra low cost airline. But in this video, we'll share some Spirit Airlines Tips we used on our recent Spirit Flight. Sure, they offer cheap fares, tiny seats, and essentially no frills. But we wanted to see just how “First Class” we could make the experience. Check out this video and let us know whether you’d call this a First Class Experience!\n\nWe flew Spirit Airlines from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. We took Spirit Airlines’ famous “Big Front Seats” which gives you more room, but doesn’t recline. \n\nWe had the full Spirit Airlines experience because we even had to deal with a Spirit Airlines delay!\n\nWe’ll even give the whole experience a “JebScore” so you know exactly what to expect from Spirit Airlines in terms of their overall service, seat, food, and experience. And, of course, we tried a Buzzball on Spirit Airlines!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:20 How to Make Spirit Airlines First Class\n4:04 Boarding Spirit Airlines\n6:59 Spirit Airlines JebScore\n8:30 Bloopers\n\nThe original #LowCostCarrierComparison:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFeqMHQObNjcy2yKTE-vfpq3J\n\nAmerican Airlines Atlantic City Bus Service:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GR4h6d4sa8\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nV1rgo – Ambre Jaune\nThe Future Lives In You (Instrumental Version) – Flux Vortex\nDelay – Stillness Speak\nTriumph – Marc Torch\nLet’s Go Now – In Bold\nLet Go of It – Wendy Marcini",

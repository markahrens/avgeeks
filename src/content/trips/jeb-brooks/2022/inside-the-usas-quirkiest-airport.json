 "description": "Watch this video to go behind the scenes at Wisconsin's Largest Airport, Milwaukee Mitchell International MKE!\n\nIn this video, you'll see the terminal and its recent renovation as well as other, less common spots! You'll see how TSA sorts and scans thousands of bags each day in their super high-tech facility.\n\nWe'll explore their cutting edge Milwaukee Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) facility and see the many vehicles they use.\n\nPerhaps best of all, we'll even see the MASSIVE machines the airport uses to continue its operations even in the harshest of winter weather!\n\nSpecial thanks to the Milwaukee County Airport Department, especially Christie Green for all of her help. Airports Revealed videos are some of the hardest I make, and they wouldn't be possible without so much effort from Airport Professionals. Thanks to you all!!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:55 MKE's Terminal Renovation\n5:08 Behind the scenes at TSA\n7:42 How MKE keeps the airport running in winter weather\n\nHere are more #AirportsRevealed Videos!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFeqB0_phJSzjYPxTUDaQ8xNC\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/",

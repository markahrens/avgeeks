  "description": "Watch this video to see what it was like to fly with Southwest Airlines from Austin to Indianapolis through the Path of Totality!\n\nThis flight was the longest commercial flight through the Total Solar Eclipse on April 8, 2024 with a routing that gave us almost ten minutes of unbelievable views.\n\nEver wondered What’s it like to fly during the 2024 Total Solar eclipse? We’ll show you in this video!\n\nWe’ll share the festivities on the ground and in the sky. But better yet, you’ll see the incredible views!\n\nWhile we weren’t able to see the moon cover the sun, what we did see was truly incredible. In fact, it was exactly what I’d wanted to see. Flying above the clouds, we watched the moon’s shadow move over the earth at 1,000 miles per hour and the light at the edge of the shadow. It was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. \n\nIt was nearly impossible to see the moon covering the sun. For that, you’re much better staying on the ground. But this light is unlike anything you can see from anywhere other than 39,000 feet. It’s simply magical!\n\nHere's the last time I flew Southwest Airlines (to meet the CEO!!)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuVAM0shvXg\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:13 Anxiety is High\n2:58 Boarding\n4:34 Complimentary Cosmic Cocktails\n5:35 Entering the Path of Totality\n7:31 Price\n\nSkylite Productions\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@sla31\n\nLuna Dog Aviation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@Lunadog99\n\nChez Aviation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@chezaviation\n\nMusic:\nSudden Rush - Dream Cave\nTiny Fast Vehicle - Magnofield\nAnxious (Instrumental Version) - Cartice\nEverlasting Youth (Barbatula)\nBeautiful Awakening - Subliminance",

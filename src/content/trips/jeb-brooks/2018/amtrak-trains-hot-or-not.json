 "description": "For years, I've heard trains in the United States are terrible! I decided to see for myself. So, in this video, we travel from Washington, DC to Greensboro, NC by Amtrak train. Is it true that trains are terrible in the United States? See for yourself by watching this video!\n\nEven though I booked an Amtrak business class seat, I also visited the coach car in order to see Amtrak Business Class vs. Coach. I also checked out the Amtrak Dining Car and tried the Amtrak food. \n\nThis trip was during the Fall of 2018, so you'll see the beautiful Autumn colors of Virginia as the Amtrak Trains travel south. This video takes a look at all of the details of the Amtrak Business Class experience so you can decide whether Amtrak Trains are great or not.\n\nPlease leave a comment about what you think of Amtrak Trains in America!\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies/\n\nAnd for planes on Instragram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksfl...\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nReptile: Cushy\nWonder: Cushy\nWorlds: Cushy\nWalk: Cushy",

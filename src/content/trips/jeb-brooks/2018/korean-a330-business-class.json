 "description": "Here's a trip report from my \"Airchive!\" I took this trip last year from Incheon in Korea to Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia in Korean Air Business Class. It was only three hours, forty minutes, but  was packed with all of Korean Air's best business class products.\n\nKorean Air A330 Business Class is a very special experience. The seats may be 2-2-2, but the food is impressive, including Bibimbap! Korean Air A330-200 Business Class is identical to the Korean Air A330 First Class in terms of the seats. This video focuses on Korean Air Business Class.\n\nI'll even share a pretty funny experience I had in the Korean Air A330 Business Class cabin with a flight attendant.\n\nWhat did you think of this flight?

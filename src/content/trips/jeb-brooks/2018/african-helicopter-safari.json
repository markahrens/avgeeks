 "description": "During my recent visit to Botswana, we got the chance to experience an African Helicopter Safari. It was awesome! Mostly because it was pretty scary since the pilot removed the doors! We felt completely exposed.\n\nAnd you will too! If you watch this African Helicopter Safari video. You'll see animals like Elephants, Crocodiles, and Hippos from above. This Robinson R44 Helicopter flew as low as a few feet off of the ground and as high as 5,000 feet...that's where it got kind of scary, honestly! Looking out the window...I mean...over the edge (there was no window) was pretty impressive.\n\nThis African Helicopter Safari was truly one of the most amazing experiences of my life. The animals didn't seem to mind us and the vantage point from a Helicopter Safari is completely different than the view from the ground. \n\nYou'll hear the Robinson R44 Startup and enjoy the amazing talents of an incredible Robinson R44 Helicopter pilot.\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nThe Expedition 1 - Johannes Bornlof\nTranscendence - Johannes Bornlof\nGravitation 5 - Johannes Bornlof\nRacing For Life - Johan Glossner",

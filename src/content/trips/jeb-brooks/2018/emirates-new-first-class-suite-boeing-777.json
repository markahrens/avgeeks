And with good reason, but this video gives you the chance to judge for yourself.\n\nWe'll experience Emirates' new first class cabin with its customizable lighting, adjustable temperature, video room service, intense privacy, and so much more!\n\nI was so excited to have the opportunity to check-out Emirates' new, fully-enclosed 777 First Class Suite that I didn't sleep the night before my flight.

No, really...watch and you'll see!\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttp://jebbrooksflies.com\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic: \nToday Is A Good Day To Live - Martin Carlberg\nSay That You Won't Go - Loving Caliber\nES_The Paper Birch - Johannes Bornlöf\nChildren Of Summer (Instrumental Version) - David Björk",

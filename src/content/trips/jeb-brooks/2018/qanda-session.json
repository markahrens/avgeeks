 "description": "I recently traveled to Kenya for a weekend. I flew with Lufthansa, AirKenya, Swiss, and United. I'll share each of those experiences in detailed trip reports in the coming weeks.\n\nFor now, I took some time during my return to the US to answer a few of the ~128 questions you all posed when the channel passed 10,000 subscribers! Take a look. If you asked a question I didn't answer, I'll post a response in the next several days.\n\nHere's a link to Blake Edgington's channel. Check him out!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Blakeyboo1985\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nTeenage Dream - Loving Caliber\nWalking on Air - Elias Naslin\nSlacker's Anthem - Elias Naslin\nReanimation - Dylan Sitts\nAll music from Epidemic Sound!",

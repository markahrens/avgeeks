 "name": "Which Is The Best Airline Lounge in Atlanta?",
 "description": "Atlanta's airport is the busiest in the world! More than 100 million people land and takeoff from its five runways every year. This means it must have some of the best airline lounges. Right?\n\nWell, you can decide for yourself which is the best airline lounge in Atlanta by watching this video.\n\nThe other day, I landed in Atlanta after a flight from Tucson, Arizona. When I looked at my connecting flight, I realized I had a four-hour layover! I decided I could either sit and read OR do something epic! So, I chose something epic: Visiting every club in the Atlanta airport in one day. This meant A LOT of walking (more than five miles) and a lot of stairs (31 flights)!\n\nThe good news? You can enjoy everything I saw without the effort. Enjoy!\n\nAnd, stick around to the end to find out how long it takes to get from one end of the airport to the other in the Atlanta airport train and even how long it takes to walk across the entire Atlanta airport! \n\nAlong the way, we'll stop off at the Delta Sky Clubs in Concourses T, A, B, C, D, E, F, the Admiral's Club in Concourse T, and the Club at ATL in Concourse F. \n\nHere are the details for each club:\nDelta Sky Club\nConcourse T (near Gate T6)\nMon – Sun:  5:00am – 10:00pm\nConference Room\n\nAmerican Airlines Admirals Club\nConcourse T (Across From Gate T11)\nMon - Fri: 4:30 am - 8 pm\nSat: 4:30 am - 7:30 pm\nSun: 5:30 am - 8 pm\nConference Room\n\nUnited Airlines Club*\nConcourse T (Between Gates T11 and T12)\nSun – Fri: 4:45 am – 8:45 pm \nSat: 4:45 am – 7:00 pm\n\nDelta Sky Club\nConcourse A (in the center on 2nd level)\nMon – Sun:  6:00am – 10:00pm\nConference Room\n\nDelta Sky Club\nConcourse A (near Gate A17)\nMon – Sun:  5:00am – 11:00pm\n\nDelta Sky Club\nConcourse B (near Gate B18)\nMon – Sun:  6:00am – 11:00pm\n\nDelta Sky Club\nConcourse C (near Gate C37)\nMon – Sun:  6:00am – 11:00pm\n\nDelta Sky Club\nConcourse D (near Gate D12)\nMon – Sun:  6:00am – 10:00pm\n\nDelta Sky Club\nConcourse D (near Gate D27)\nMon – Sun:  6:00am – 11:00pm\n\nDelta Sky Club\nConcourse E (across from Gate E15)\nMon – Sun:  6:00am – 10:00pm\nShowers\n\nDelta Sky Club\nConcourse F (Mezzanine Level)\nMon – Sun:  5:30am – 11:00pm\nShowers\nSun Deck\n\nThe Club at ATL\nConcourse F (Mezzanine Level)\nMon – Sun:  6:00am – 10:30 pm\n\n* I missed the United Airlines Club during my visit.

 "description": "I was looking forward to sharing my first flight with SAS with you. Unfortunately, when I arrived at London's Heathrow airport for my flight to Copenhagen, I learned the SAS flight from CPH - IAD was cancelled. As a result, I was rebooked onto a Virgin Atlantic A330 flying directly from LHR - IAD. (The thumbnail photo for the video is of a Virgin A340 I saw later...sorry, just really liked the photo!!)\n\nThis Virgin Atlantic A330 trip report highlights the Virgin Clubhouse and the Virgin Atlantic Upper Class a/k/a Virgin Atlantic Business Class experience. \n\nThe Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse is unbelievable! In this video, we'll explore the entire Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse experience. From the food to the spa to the deck with its fantastic plane spotting, it's one of the best spots in all of London Heathrow!\n\nThe Virgin Atlantic A330 Upper Class (Business Class) experience on this particular plane (G-LUV) was a bit strange.The seating is, well, frankly weird! But we'll explore every aspect of the Virgin Atlantic A330 Upper Class experience. \n\nLet me know what you think by leaving a comment!\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies/\n\nAnd for planes on Instragram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksfl...\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nPullen Park: Sarah, The Illstrumentalist\nLast Day of Summer: Sarah, The Illstrumentalist\nSanta Cruise: Sarah, The Illstrumentalist\nNomad Life: Sarah, The Illstrumentalist",

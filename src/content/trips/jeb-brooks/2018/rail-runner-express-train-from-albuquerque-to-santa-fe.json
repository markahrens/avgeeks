The Rail Runner Express is popular among both tourists and commuters moving through Central New Mexico. \n\nJoin me on a short 95 minute Rail Runner Express train ride from Downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico north to the State's Capital in Santa Fe. This short video highlights the cars, the scenery, and a few spots around Santa Fe. I'll even share a bit of information about the train, the route, and the destination along the way!\n\nI'd particularly appreciate your feedback about how to improve these trip reports.

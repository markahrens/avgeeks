 "description": "Join me for this amazing experience Bush Flying in Africa. The best way to get around Botswana is by air and this trip includes four, separate planes:\n\nGippsland GA-8 Airvan (A2-AAC & A2-AKT);\nQuest Kodiak (A2-SRM); and \nCessna 208B Grand Caravan (A2-OKC).\n\nWhen I first visited Africa, I wasn't sure what the internal flights would be like. Frankly, the idea of Bush Flying in Africa kind of intimidated me. Between weight restrictions, unpredictable schedules, and unknown airplanes, I had no idea what to expect. Watch this video to gain a little bit of insight into Bush Flying in Africa.\n\nYou'll see takeoffs and landings from the best seats on the planes! I'll also give you a bit of insight about what to expect if you're considering taking a trip to Botswana and are wondering what Bush Flying Africa will be like. Bush Flying is incredible, but African Bush Flying is a even more amazing. This video shows some of the highlights!\n\nWe flew over Botswana's desert, the Okavango Delta, and lots of other beautiful parts of this spectacular country. I think the Okavango Delta was the most beautiful!\n\nSpeaking of favorites, which of the planes was your favorite?

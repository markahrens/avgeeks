 "description": "Watch this video to see Delta Air Lines get put to the ultimate test! What’s it like to fly their Delta One Business Class Suite on their flagship A350 for 24 hours from Atlanta to Los Angeles and on to Sydney? We’re about to find out!\n\nThis video will highlight the Delta One seat, the Delta Air Lines Business Class food, the Delta A350 inflight entertainment, the new Delta Sky Club in Los Angeles, and Delta’s onboard service. We’ll even give the whole thing a “JebScore!”\n\nPerhaps the coolest thing about this trip is that we booked the entire thing in an A350 and, thanks to the quirks of the Delta schedule, the plane we took from Atlanta also took us to Sydney. But just wait to see how we prove that to you!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:16 Atlanta to Los Angeles\n5:39 Los Angeles Sky Club\n7:56 Los Angeles to Sydney\n11:38 Delta Air Lines JebScore\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com\n \nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies\n \nCheck me out on Twitter, too:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n \nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n \nMusic:\nTime Bender - Philip Ayers\nNot Getting Younger (Instrumental Version) - Maybe\nAdore Me (Instrumental Version) - Maybe\nLike a Rollercoaster (Instrumental Version) - Mindme\nI Wait for You (Instrumental Version) - Lupus Nocte\nHurricane (Instrumental Version) - Courses\nTo the Other Side - This Other Space\nWhere We Started (Instrumental Version) - Victor Lundberg\nPassageways - Ballpoint\nMost High - JOYSPRING\nThe Seagrass Meadow - Trevor Kowalkski\nStripping Down Nude (Instrumental Version) - ELWIN",

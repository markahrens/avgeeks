 "description": "Watch this video to compare the cheapest vs most expensive trip between DC and NYC! You'll see what it’s like to travel between Washington, DC and New York City on the cheapest bus versus the most expensive First Class High-Speed Train!\n\nWe’ll start out by leaving Washington onboard the Megabus with tickets as cheap as one dollar! You’ll see everything this super cheap mode of transportation provides. Or, I guess how little it provides! We’ll give you a tour of the bus, and the seat, and share some of the best sights along the way.\n\nOn the way back from New York, we’ll travel on Amtrak’s Acela High Speed train in First Class. We’ll showcase the unlimited drinks and meals you can expect (along with a disappointing surprise we encountered.) \n\nAt the end, we’ll compare the cheapest vs most expensive trip between DC and NYC and give a verdict about which one you’re more likely to see us onboard next time in this Bus vs Train comparison!\n \n0:00 Introduction\n1:26 Megabus \n7:13 Acela\n13:01 Our Verdict\n\nMore Bus Videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh1ULPYMQhI&list=PLQhp4hw0kFer-HswdSz_6Y9PJxdmBCOqH\n\nPlane Versus Train:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVLnQFTazz8&t=40s\n\nAmtrak Acela First Class:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHF8ajhAZa8\n \nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com\n \nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies\n \nCheck me out on Twitter, too:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n \nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n \nMusic:\nI’ve Had Enough (Instrumental Version) - Snake City\nTalk About It (Instrumental Version) - Alder\nCan We Talk Now (Instrumental Version) - Mindme\nRomeo (Instrumental Version) - MNDLSS\nPress Send - Erik Fernholm\nKia Kaha - spring gang\nSay It Again 2.0 - Chris Shards\nI’ve Had Enough (Instrumental Version) - Snake City",

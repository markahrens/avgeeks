 "name": "First Flight from the ONLY STATE Without Flights (Avelo Airlines)",
 "description": "Watch this video to see what it’s like to fly with the new low cost carrier Avelo Airlines!\n\nWe took the inaugural flight from Wilmington, Delaware to Orlando, Florida in February 2023 to see what this low cost airline is really like. If you watch this video you’ll see everything Avelo Airlines offers, which is not much.\n\nWe’ll even showcase the extras we paid for including carry-on bags, priority boarding, and even seat selection, which didn’t work.\n\nYou’ll even see a JebScore for the airline at the end of the video and a water cannon salute for this brand new service.\n\nThis is also exciting because low cost airline Avelo Airlines adding service to Wilmington, Delaware means Delaware is no longer the only state in the United States without passenger flights! So, that made this celebration a big deal, so you’ll see the party the Wilmington, DE airport threw, too!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:32 Avelo Airlines Inaugural Flight Party\n3:42 Boarding\n7:36 Avelo Airlines JebScore\n9:35 Water Cannon Salute \n\nIf you want to see the FULL FLIGHT, check out Skylite Productions\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3QhjhdxGPI\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com\n \nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies\n \nCheck me out on Twitter, too:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n \nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n \nMusic:\nEverything You Need (Instrumental Version) - waykap\nLost Maiden (Hollow) (Instrumental Version) - dasloe\nLike Sand (Instrumental Version) - Filthy The Kid\nCold blooded (Instrumental Version) - dasloe\nEverything’s Gonna Be Okay - Marc Torch",

We’ll give you our cruise tips for this crossing on this Cunard Cruise on an Ocean Liner! This Cunard Cruise Review is our first time traveling by ship and we chose to do it right by traveling in a Queens Grill Suite, but not just any Suite, but a Penthouse on the Seas!\n\nNow, to be fair, this isn’t a “Cruise” in the traditional sense, instead, it’s called a “Crossing!”\n\nWe’ll even explain how Cunard dining works on QM2, including all of the options available. We’ll explain the difference between Queens Grill, Princess Grill, and Britannia. \n\nYou’ll even get an idea of how much a transatlantic cruise costs, from the cheapest to the most expensive options.\n\nSo, join Suzanne and me inside Queen Mary 2 as we travel on the QM2 across the Atlantic Ocean!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:53 Boarding Queen Mary 2\n2:12 Sailing Away from Southampton\n6:03 Queen Mary 2 Ship Tour\n12:11 Queens Grill Penthouse Suite Tour\n14:58 Gala Night\n16:39 24 Hours on Queen Mary 2\n18:45 Dining Options on Queen Mary 2\n21:45 Bad Weather on Queen Mary2\n25:24 Second Gala Night\n28:42 Arriving into New York\n32:03 Bloopers\n\n​​For more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com\n \nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies\n \nCheck me out on Twitter, too:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n \nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n \nMusic:\nMicro Evolution - Howard Harper-Barnes\nNew Grasp - Aorora\nDiscoveries - Clarence Reed\nMiika’s Journey - Lama House\nTall Poppy - Alfie-Jay Winters\nMagma - Lama House\nBig Announcement - Out To The World\nSo Alone (Instrumental Version) - Filthy The Kid\nVivacity - Phello\nSoft Expectations - Gold in June\nMorning Rises - Airae\nCoalescence - Airae\nWicked Man - Martin Landstrom\nA Beginning - Rymdklang Soundtracks\nCourageous Endeavor - Airae\nBad Vibe - Crystal Shards\nIsland to Island - Adriel Fair\nThe Light from Within - Howard Harper-Barnes\nThe Kill (Instrumental Version) - Particle House\nMemories of You - Marc Torch\nTo the Last Man - Jon Bjork\nReflected - Pearce Roswell",

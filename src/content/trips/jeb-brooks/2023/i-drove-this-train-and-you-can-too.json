 "description": "Watch this video to see how to drive a train from 1950.\n\nThe North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, NC invited me to come and experience their \"At The Throttle\" session. This Drive a train experience is available to the public and I'll show you how you can participate in this incredible program that allows visitors to operate one of the museum's locomotives. \n\nThe North Carolina Transportation Museum, located in Spencer, NC - about an hour north of Charlotte - just happens to be about 45 minutes from my home in Greensboro, NC!\n\nThis facility began life as the main facility servicing and overhauling steam locomotives and other equipment for the Southern Railway, which operated lines between Atlanta and Washington, DC. \n\nBefore driving this train, we'll explore the NC Train Museum in Spencer, NC and even go inside the historic Spencer NC Roundhouse, the largest one still in use here in North America!\n\nI was invited to operate their 6133 Locomotive from Southern Railway. It was originally built in 1950 and I learned quickly just how complicated operating this locomotive really was!\n\nThis is a lot more than just a historic train ride! We'll actually drive a historic train!\n\nPlease note: I was a guest of the NC Transportation Museum.

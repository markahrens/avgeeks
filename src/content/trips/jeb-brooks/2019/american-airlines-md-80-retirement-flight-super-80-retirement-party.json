 "name": "American Airlines MD-80 Retirement Flight + “Super 80” Retirement Party",
 "description": "September 4, 2019 marked the last day American Airlines would operate their iconic MD-80 “Super 80” aircraft in revenue service. It was the #Super80Sendoff. I couldn’t miss this retirement day for the American Airlines MD-80. So I hope you’ll join me on this special flight!\n\nWhen American Airlines announced the last American Airlines MD-80 flight, from Dallas to Chicago, they named the flight American Airlines flight 80, in honor of the Super 80. That flight sold out quickly! But I was able to snag a seat on the last American Airlines MD-80 flight from Raleigh, NC to Dallas, TX. This American Airlines MD-80 Flight would also give me access to the party thrown before the very last Super 80 flight ever.\n\nIn this video, we’ll explore a little of the history of the American Airlines MD-80, check out the service, and the seat. We’ll even join the party American Airlines threw for their MD-80’s retirement. You’ll even get the chance to hear from American Airlines CEO, Doug Parker about his feelings about the American Airlines MD-80 and its retirement.\n\nFull Take-off and Landing Footage Link:\nhttps://youtu.be/4JZTJCDcVgw\n\nBe sure to check out my friend Jon Ostrower’s spectacular Aviation News Service, The Air Current:\n\nhttps://theaircurrent.com\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nSentimental Summer – The Undertowns\nLate in the Day – The Undertowns\nSilent Forest - Kikoru\n\nThumbnail Photo by Wyatt Stockton\nhttps://www.instagram.com/imagine_wealth/",

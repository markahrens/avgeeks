 "name": "Delta A220 Inaugural Flight",
 "description": "Delta Air Lines is proud of their new Delta A220 (a/k/a the Bombardier C-Series). Delta is, after all, the first airline in North America to operate the Delta A220.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be on the inaugural flight from New York’s LaGuardia Airport to Dallas-Fort Worth. Based on my experience, the Delta A220 was an impressive aircraft. But watch this video to judge the Delta A220 for yourself!\n\nDelta Air Lines claims their A220 offers an improved passenger experience. The Delta A220 offers bigger overhead bins, larger inflight entertainment screens, and even wider seats in Economy and Comfort +.\n\nI sat in Seat 3A, First Class for this first-ever passenger flight on a Delta A220 from New York to Dallas. Join me on this flight so you can decide for yourself whether the Delta A220 is as good as the airline claims it is!\n\nSpecial thanks to Cody Aviation for the thumbnail image of the Delta A220.

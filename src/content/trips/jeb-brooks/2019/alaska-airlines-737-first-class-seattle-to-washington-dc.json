 "description": "Let's check out Alaska Airlines First Class from Washington to Washington. We'll review the lounge, seat, food, entertainment, and the crew on this five hour flight across the United States. You'll see the window views, hear the engine, and walk away with a sense of Alaska Airlines First Class! \n\nHere's a link to the full take-off and landing along with some in-flight footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/T5ta-qVa3e4\n\nAlaska Airlines wasn't in the original #TransconThrowdown because they didn't offer a lie flat seat. If you want to check out that series, here's a link:\n\nhttp://jeb.flights/TransconThrowdown\n\nBut, despite not having a lie flat seat, Alaska Airlines First Class was amazing. The food was great, the seat was comfortable, but it was the Alaska Airlines crew that set this flight apart. Just listen to the Alaska Airlines Captain's announcement. That, alone, made the Alaska Airlines flight special.\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nPlease check out Paul Stewart's channel, too:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChEU4Y6IZ-xcuCQ8l0XDH4A\n\nMusic:\nA New River - Viriya\nTokay Gecko - Viriya",

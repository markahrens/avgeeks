 "description": "What happens between the time you drop off your bag at the ticket counter and when you pick it up at baggage claim?\n\nIn this video, we’ll go behind the scenes to understand what happens below your feet as you prepare for a flight. We’ll look at the baggage system, the loading process, as well as visit the ramp tower.\n\nWe’ll get to know what it takes to be a great ramp agent and take a few minutes to recognize just how critical ramp agents and ramp tower controllers are to running a successful airline.\n\nThe scale of this operation is overwhelming:\n\nAs many as 80,000 to 100,000 bags flow through the baggage system at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport each day. Ramp Agents can load as many as 50,000 pounds of sand on flights in a given day. The airport averages 2,700 daily arrivals and departures.\n\nCheck out this video to see how the ramp supports this volume of effort.\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nPuzzle of Complexity – Jo Wandrini\nTomorrow is Another Day – Jo Wandrini\nLet’s Go Go Go – Tigerblood Jewel\nSomething Special – Spectacles Wallet and Watch\nA Place of Wonder – Jo Wandrini",

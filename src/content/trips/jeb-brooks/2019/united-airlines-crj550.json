 "description": "In order to provide upgraded service on short routes, United Airlines worked with Bombardier to develop a new airplane, the CRJ550. Today, GoJet Airlines inaugurated service on the planes. I was on the first CRJ550 flight to my home airport, Piedmont Triad International Airport (GSO).\n\nThe CRJ550 is really just a CRJ700 with fewer seats, but United Airlines used the opportunity to completely redesign the 50 passenger regional jet. The CRJ550 offers passengers the choice of First Class, Premium Economy, and Economy. Passengers in all classes of service on the CRJ550 have the opportunity to keep their roll-aboard bag with them in the cabin, forgoing the need to gate check a bag, which has always been required on these planes in the past.\n\nIn this video, we’ll compare the most common 50 seat regional jet, the CRJ200 to this innovative new CRJ550. I’ll give you my opinions, but more importantly, I hope you’ll share your thoughts about the CRJ550 in the comments section. I can’t wait to see what you think of this new airplane.\n\nHere's iTripReport's video about the \"true\" inaugural flight to Harrisburg:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvTj1-vb5k\n\nLink to the Unedited Take-off and Landing Footage:\nCRJ Full Takeoffs \nhttps://youtu.be/F5idJWG84ko\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nOur Sad Regrets – Cobby Costa\nIn a Million Days – Rijko\nNorthern Lights – Liru\nMorning Rises – Airae",

 "description": "Delta Premium Select first appeared onboard an Airbus A350 in October 2017 with the Inaugural Flight of Delta's A350. I was on that flight, but had a seat in Delta One. I've been looking for a chance to try out Delta's Premium Economy Product: Premium Select.\n\nRecently, Delta needed to reposition an Airbus A350 from Atlanta to Seattle, so I jumped at the chance to try Delta Premium Select for the first time. Because this was a domestic route, Delta Premium Select was treated like Comfort Plus. \n\nIn other words, even though the hard product is the same as Delta's International Premium Economy, \"Delta Premium Select,\" the soft product is Delta's domestic Premium Economy product, \"Comfort Plus.\"\n\nIn this video, I'll share the flight experience and highlight the differences between Delta Premium Select and Comfort+.\n\nHere's a link to the full takeoff and landing:\nhttps://youtu.be/gvvhXO7ORXk\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck out SANspotter:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/sanspotter\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nAll the Feels - Sarah the Instrumentalist\nMars Adventure - Brendon Moeller\nAir Bed - Osoku",

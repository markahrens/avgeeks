 "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees the enormously complex Air Traffic Control system in the United States. Thanks to the FAA, this video goes behind the scenes at Air Traffic Control to places never before seen by a YouTube Channel in order to understand How Air Traffic Control works!\n\nThe airspace around the busiest airport in the world seemed like a good place to explore How Air Traffic Control Works, so that’s exactly where we went: Atlanta, Georgia. There, like most of the rest of the world, Air Traffic Controllers manage the airspace. \n\nAs important as an Air Traffic Control Tower is, there’s a lot more to How Air Traffic Control Works than just that. In this video, we’ll explore the whole system in order to understand how Air Traffic Control Works.  \n\nSpecial Thanks to the FAA, particularly Kathleen Bergen, Torrance Branch, Kenny Smith, and so many others. This was an incredible opportunity to see How Air Traffic Control Works.\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nYeah Cool – Cassa\nCool Cat – V.V.

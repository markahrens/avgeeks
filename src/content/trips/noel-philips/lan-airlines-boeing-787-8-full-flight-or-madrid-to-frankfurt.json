 "description": "A full length full flight video in real time with LAN Airlines, from Madrid to Frankfurt, onboard Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner CC-BBB operating flight LA704 on October 18 2014.\n\nWe pushback from the gate at Madrid's Terminal 4 Satellite pier with a short taxi out for departure from runway 15L, followed by a very smooth departure and climb up to our cruising altitude of 43,000ft.  At this altitude the sky is visibly dark above and the curvature of the earth visible as we make our way up across Spain directly to Paris, before making a right turn directly towards Frankfurt.  We are then treated to a stunning approach looping around downtown Frankfurt before making our approach to runway 25L, after a flight time of only 1 hour 59 minutes (scheduled flight time 2h45m).\n\nVideo taken from seat 31L.\n\nAirline:  LAN Airlines\nFlight:  LA704\nAircraft:  Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner CC-BBB\nFrom:  Madrid Barajas (MAD)\nTo:  Frankfurt (FRA)\nDeparture:  15:18\nArrival:  17:17\nFlight Time:  01:59\nSeat:  31L\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/mUw979\n\nPlease enjoy the flight and feel free to subscribe/comment!\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

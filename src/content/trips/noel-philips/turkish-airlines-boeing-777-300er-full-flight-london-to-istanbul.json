We enter the terminal and head to check in, before going through security to the departure lounge.  Our flight today goes from B pier so we take the underground tunnel to the B pier where our aircraft is waiting for us.\n\nWe board the aircraft and take our seat in 42A, and it isn't long before we push back for our taxi to runway 27L.  Before long we take off and are treated to a fantastic view for most of the flight due to the unusually clear weather across the whole of Europe.  We fly over the North Sea, towards the Netherlands before crossing Germany, Czechia, Hungary and Romania, before commencing our descent across Bulgaria.  Istanbul isn't as pleasant as London today but it's still a relatively clear day, as we make our approach over the Sea of Marmara, making a bumpy touchdown on runway 05.  We're lucky to get a remote stand today, and disembark via steps in front of the enormous GE90 engines to the waiting bus.  We are driven to the busy terminal to await our next flight.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:04 Outside Terminal 2 at Heathrow, walking into terminal\n0:02:24 Walking from check in to security\n0:03:14 After security, walking to departure lounge\n0:07:16 Walking from departure lounge through tunnel to B pier\n0:16:41 Gate B44\n0:17:20 Boarding announced\n0:19:10 Boarding the aircraft, taking our seat in 42A\n0:24:58 Cabin view\n0:26:23 Seat overview\n0:29:35 Cabin view\n0:43:48 Safety video\n0:48:37 Pushback truck attached\n0:58:36 Pushback and engine start\n1:11:24 Concorde\n1:12:42 Line up and wait runway 27L\n1:15:27 Takeoff runway 27L\n1:26:23 London Stansted Airport\n1:27:36 Cabin view\n1:46:17 Ijmuden, Netherlands\n1:48:00 Amsterdam, Netherlands\n1:57:11 Enschede, Netherlands\n2:05:15 Lunch service\n2:11:09 Lunch: Chicken and potato\n2:21:23 Halle, Germany\n02:22:17 Leipzig-Halle Airport, Germany\n02:23:08 Leipzig, Germany\n02:30:45 Dresden, Germany\n02:44:45 Coffee service\n02:49:04 Brno, Czechia\n02:57:29 Cabin tour of entire economy class cabin from front to back\n03:07:13 Budapest, Hungary\n03:17:19 Tour of air show map system\n03:21:31 Arad, Romania\n03:25:18 Chasing our shadow\n03:33:17 Tour of inflight entertainment system\n03:40:03 Craiova, Romania\n03:46:34 Cabin view\n04:15:18 Commencing approach to Istanbul\n04:32:23 Final approach to runway 05 at Istanbul\n04:37:28 Bosphorous European Airways fleet stored at Istanbul\n04:38:04 Pulling onto remote stand\n04:40:39 Disembarking aircraft via steps, boarding bus to terminal\n04:46:20 Bus ride to terminal\n04:48:04 Entering terminal, walking to passport control\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

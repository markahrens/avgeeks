 "description": "A timelapse flight video with Swiss, from Zurich to Luxembourg, onboard Avro RJ100 HB-IYQ operating flight LX754 on July 29 2016.\n\nOur flight begins at Zurich Airport on a remote stand, and we are soon on our way with the aircraft less than 50% full.\n\nWe get our clearance to taxi and we make our way out to runway 28, taking our place in the line.  We are then treated to a beautiful departure from Zurich, getting a view of both engines spooling up on the right wing.\n\nIt isn't long before we commence our approach into Luxembourg, getting vectors from ATC for the ILS approach to runway 24.  We enjoy a beautiful approach across Luxembourg before a smooth touchdown on schedule in Luxembourg.",

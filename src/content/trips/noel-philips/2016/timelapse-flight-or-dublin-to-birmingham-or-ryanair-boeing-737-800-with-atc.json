 "description": "A timelapse flight from Dublin to Birmingham onboard Ryanair Boeing 737-800 EI-FOZ, operating flight FR664 on April 5 2016.  \n\nAfter boarding this smart, shiny aircraft, we push back and taxi to runway 28, departing on a beautiful sunny spring morning across Ireland.  We climb to our cruising altitude of FL230, and cross the Irish Sea north of Wales.  We get a great view of the Isle of Man and Liverpool, before we make a right turn and commence our descent over Cheshire towards Birmingham.  \n\nIt remains a clear sunny day for the entire flight and we get a stunning view of the whole of Birmingham as we commence our approach to runway 33 at Birmingham.\n\nWe touch down a few minutes ahead of schedule on runway 33, before taxying into the terminal.\n\nVideo taken from seat 8A.\n\nAirline:  Ryanair\nFlight:  FR664\nAircraft:  Boeing 737-800 EI-FOZ\nFrom:  Dublin (DUB)\nTo:  Birmingham (BHX)\nDeparture:  10:55\nArrival:  11:38\nFlight Time:  00:43\nSeat:  8A\nFlight Path:  https://goo.gl/DxVJBm\n\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

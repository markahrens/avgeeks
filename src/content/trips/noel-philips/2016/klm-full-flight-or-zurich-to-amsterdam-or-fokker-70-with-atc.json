 "description": "A full length, real time full flight video from Zurich to Amsterdam onboard KLM Cityhopper Fokker 70 PH-WXD, operating flight KL1960 from Zurich to Amsterdam on January 30 2016.\n\n**ATC for the full flight courtesy of LiveATC.net**\n\nWe board our flight after a 20 minute delay, caused by problems opening the cargo door after the inbound flight from Amsterdam.  Once we're onboard, it isn't long before we receive our departure clearance for Amsterdam, before pushing and taxying out to runway 32.  We make an incredible takeoff from Zurich, getting a great buzzsaw sound from the Rolls-Royce engines, rocketing out of Zurich in a very steep climb.\n\nWe get a great view of Switzerland as we climb to FL320, routing up to Amsterdam via France, Luxembourg and Belgium.  The crew contact KLM operations in Amsterdam to verify the state of the passengers with connections (myself included!), and advise us straight away of the status of those connections (thankfully mine wasn't affected!).\n\nWe initially commence our approach to runway 27 at Amsterdam Schiphol, before breaking off on short final to land on runway 24 and taxying to the remote stands.\n\nAirline:  KLM Cityhopper\nFlight:  KL1960\nAircraft:  Fokker 70 PH-WXD\nFrom:  Zurich (ZRH)\nTo:  Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS)\nDeparture:  14:42\nArrival:  15:48\nFlight Time:  01:16\nSeat:  15F\nFlight Path: http://goo.gl/nMEUbx\n\nFilmed from seat 15F.\n\n\n********************************************************************\nPlease subscribe, comment and like, and follow me for regular full flight and behind the scenes videos!\n\nFacebook:  facebook.com/inflightvideo\nTwitter: twitter.com/inflightvideo\nG+: plus.google.com/+inflightvideo\nInstagram: instagram.com/inflightvideo\n********************************************************************\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

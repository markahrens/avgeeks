We push back from the stand and taxi out to runway 18C, before making a beautiful departure over the bright lights of Dallas.  We make a left turn, climbing to 37,000ft as we head towards the sunrise.\n\nOur route takes us over Arkansas and Tennessee, passing Memphis and Nashville before the sun starts to rise over eastern Tennessee.  From there we head across North Carolina towards Charlotte, descending through some bumpy weather.  We make our approach for runway 18R at Charlotte, touching down smoothly ahead of schedule before taxying in to the terminal. \n\nThumbnail: RJJAviation (http://www.airplane-pictures.net/photo/835529/n179uw-american-airlines-airbus-a321/)\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

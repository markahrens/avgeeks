We head for our gate where today's flight is waiting for us.\n\nWe board the aircraft and take our seat in 21A.  Before long we push back and start making our way to runway 9.  We depart on a beautiful clear afternoon getting some great views of Massachussetts and Rhode Island as we make our way south.  Soon the weather closes in and we endure a bumpy ride through stormy conditions as we fly overhead New York City and make our way towards Washington.  The weather remains cloudy for much of our flight and we eventually start our descent towards Washington.  We emerge from the clouds as we join our final approach to runway 1 at Reagan National Airport.\n\nAfter landing, we taxi to the terminal and disembark, making our way through the terminal to the kerb side.\n\nAirline: jetBlue Airways\nFlight: B61089\nAircraft: Embraer 190 N197JB\nFrom: Boston (BOS)\nTo: Washington (DCA)\nDeparture: 16:27\nArrival: 17:38\nFlight Time: 1:11\nSeat: 21A\n\n\n\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

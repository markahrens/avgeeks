 "name": "Onboard Go Around at Zurich: Swiss Bombardier C Series CS100 (with ATC)",
 "description": "Onboard view of a late go-around at Zurich (ZRH), onboard a Swiss Bombardier C Series CS100, operating flight LX391 from Manchester on July 29 2016.  Includes ATC for the approach and second approach.  \n\n**First go-around of a Bombardier C Series in commercial service!**\n\nWe commence our final approach for runway 14, and although ATC have asked us to slow down, we are coming in hot and high for our landing.  As we cross the threshold about to touch down, we go around for a second approach.  We climb out from Zurich in the powerful CS100, getting a great view of the airport and Lake Zurich as we are vectored around for our second, successful this time, landing.\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

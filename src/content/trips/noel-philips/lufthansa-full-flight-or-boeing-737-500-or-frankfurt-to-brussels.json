 "description": "A full length full flight video onboard Lufthansa Boeing 737-500 D-ABIX, operating flight LH1018 from Frankfurt (FRA) to Brussels (BRU) on 24 July 2014. \n\nThe flight begins on stand in Frankfurt and is unique in that the entire flight is spent skirting around the numerous storms across Europe on this day.  Initially we head south out of Frankfurt to avoid weather before heading north towards Brussels, arriving after a flight time of 40 minutes.  The evening light made this a beautiful flight, in particular the approach and landing into Brussels over some beautiful countryside.\n\nVideo taken from seat 5F.\n\n\nMap of Flight:  http://goo.gl/NtPNQg\nFlight Details:  http://goo.gl/BIi4Uv\n\nPlease enjoy the flight and feel free to subscribe/comment!\n\nGoPro Hero 3\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

We meet fellow YouTuber WindowSeat and proceed to gate B34 where our aircraft is pulling onto stand as we arrive, 18 year old Boeing 737-31S YL-BBS, originally delivered to Deutsche BA in 1999.\n\nAfter the safety demonstration we are cleared to push back from the gate and make our way to runway 24, before climbing through the low fog straight into a wonderful day above.  We make our way north east across The Netherlands, before crossing Germany near to Kiel, and passing to the south of Copenhagen.\n\nWe get a wonderful view of the south coast of Sweden as we fly the length of the Baltic Sea, the weather clouding over below us as we cross the Latvian coastline north of Liepaja.  We descend through the cloud to be greeted by a snowy day on the ground, before touching down smoothly on runway 36 after a flight time of just under two hours.\n\nWe taxi to the terminal and disembark into the small, but modern terminal, making our way to the street outside the airport.\n\n0:00:03  Walking through passport control and airport at Schiphol\n0:10:05  Aircraft arrives on stand\n0:12:10  Boarding the aircraft, taking our seat in 5A\n0:19:59  Cabin overview\n0:20:22  ATC Route Clearance to Riga\n0:22:24  Passenger trying to bring huge boxes onboard\n0:23:50  Cabin overview\n0:45:43  Doors closed, jetway removed\n0:50:31  Safety demonstration\n0:53:10  ATC Push and start clearance\n0:57:31  Pushback, with multi angle\n1:00:10  Taxi clearance and taxi\n1:06:25  Line up runway 24, takeoff with multi angle\n1:15:48  Meal service - Scandinavian Breakfast\n1:33:09  Drinks Service\n1:45:48  Business Cabin overview\n1:53:24  Near to Sonderborg, Denmark\n2:00:00  Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmo, Sweden\n2:05:08  Ystad, Sweden\n2:15:29  Karlskrona, Sweden\n2:21:49  Overhead passenger control panel\n2:49:26  ATC: Contacting Riga Approach, multi angle through descent\n3:00:43  Established on ILS, contacting Riga Tower\n3:02:36  Break through cloud, landing on runway 36\n3:11:11  Disembark through forward doors, bus to terminal, walk to landside\n\n\nCREDITS\nATC: liveatc.net\nSecond Angle - WindowSeat (http://www.youtube.com/windowseatvideo)\nThumbnail: Jan Arik Ittensammer (http://www.airplane-pictures.net/photo/644884/yl-bbl-air-baltic-boeing-737-300/)\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

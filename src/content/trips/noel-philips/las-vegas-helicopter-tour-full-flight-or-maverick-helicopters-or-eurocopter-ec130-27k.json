 "description": "A full length, full flight video with Maverick Helicopters operating a helicopter tour of Las Vegas.\n\nThe video begins with our transfer from our hotel, The Venetian, onboard Maverick's limo bus.  We arrive at the Signature private terminal at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, ahead of our flight on the sporty EC130 for our helicopter tour.\n\nBefore long we walk out to our helicopter receiving our safety briefing from the pilot, before boarding the helicopter in the front seat and firing up the engines.  We make a sporty takeoff over the Sands corporate jet fleet, and over the infamous JANET Boeing 737s used to transport workers to nearby Area 51.\n\nWe then head up the famous Las Vegas strip getting a phenomenal view of the hotels and casinos, buzzing the Stratosphere tower at low level before making a U-turn over Fremont Street.\n\nWe then buzz the Strat again getting a great view of the ACM Party For A Cause festival that is getting underway beneath us.  From there it's down the strip again towards the famous Luxor hotel, again swooping down over the private jet ramps and touching down smoothly at the Signature terminal.\n\nWe disembark the helicopter back into the terminal to get our bus back to the hotel.\n\nAirline:  Maverick Helicopters\nFlight:  N/A\nAircraft:  Eurocopter EC130T2 N872MH\nFrom:  Las Vegas (LAS)\nTo:  Las Vegas (LAS)\nDeparture:  12:26\nArrival:  12:40\nFlight Time:  00:14\nSeat: N/A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/e4pppX\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

 "description": "Full flight Timelapse video from gate to gate onboard Flybe DHC8-Q400 G-ECOD, operating flight BE552 from East Midlands (EMA) to Glasgow (GLA) on 1 December 2014.  \n\nThe flight begins in the terminal at East Midlands, before we walk across the ramp to board our waiting aircraft.  Once on board, we push back from the gate and taxi out to runway 09 for a departure to the east.  With a low cloudbase we are in the cloud before we reach the other end of the runway, but soon emerge to a beautiful sunny day over Nottingham, the steam from Radcliffe-on-Soar power station clearly visible above the cloud.  It remains fairly cloudy for much of the flight up the country, however we get a brief view of the ground over the Lake District, before we begin our descent into Glasgow.  The cloudbase is a little higher in Glasgow, and we emerge from the clouds getting a good view over the outskirts of the city before landing onto runway 23 and taxying into the terminal after a flight time of 52 minutes.\n\nVideo taken from seat 7A.\n\nAirline:  Flybe\nFlight:  BE552\nAircraft:  Bombardier DHC8-Q400 G-ECOD\nFrom:  East Midlands (EMA)\nTo:  Glasgow (GLA)\nDeparture:  08:59\nArrival:  09:51\nFlight Time:  00:52\nSeat:  7A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/L8fefB\n\nPlease enjoy the flight and feel free to subscribe/comment!\n\nGoPro Hero 3\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

I arrive at the gate after the rest of the passengers have boarded, and quickly make my way to the bus that will take us to our aircraft for today - DHC8-Q400 G-JEDM.\n\nWe take our seat in seat 7D and before long the engines start and we are free to catch our breath.  We make a short taxi to the active runway at Edinburgh before departing to the west, and making a left turn.  The cloudy weather soon turns into a beautiful day as we head across Northern England and the Lake District, and we are treated to some magnificent views on approach to East Midlands Airport.\n\nAfter following a non standard arrival pattern, flying past the airport and then making a left turn back around overhead Loughborough, we commence our final approach to runway 27 at East Midlands Airport, where we touch down on schedule on a beautiful summer day.\n\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

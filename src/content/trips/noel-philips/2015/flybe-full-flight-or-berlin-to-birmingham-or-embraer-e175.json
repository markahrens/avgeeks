 "description": "A full length, full flight video from gate to gate onboard Flybe Embraer E-175 G-FBJF, operating flight BE1859 from Berlin Tegel (TXL) to Birmingham (BHX) on November 27 2014.  *Every minute of the flight included from gate to gate, including cabin shots*\n\nThe video starts at the departure gate and includes the bus ride to the aircraft, before boarding from the rear stairs\n\nWe pushback from a remote stand at Berlin, before taxying straight out to runway 08R for departure.  We climb out getting a distant view of the city of Berlin, before making a left turn to backtrack towards Hannover, climbing to an initial cruise altitude of FL360.  Clear skies give us a lovely view of the German countryside as we climb to FL380, before the cloud starts to build up overhead Amsterdam.  It doesn't last long though, and as we descend towards the English coast at Clacton-on-Sea we get a great view, before turning right to the northeast of London and descending directly towards runway 33 at Birmingham.  \n\nVideo taken from seat 16D.\n\nAirline:  Flybe\nFlight:  BE1859\nAircraft:  Embraer E-175 G-FBJF\nFrom:   Berlin Tegel (TXL)\nTo:  Birmingham (BHX)\nDeparture:  13:28\nArrival:  13:59\nFlight Time:  01:31\nSeat:  16D\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/ugHsxH\n\nPlease enjoy the flight and feel free to subscribe/comment!\n\nGoPro Hero 3\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

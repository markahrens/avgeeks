 "description": "I took a flight with LOT Polish Airlines on their Embraer ERJ195 to film this trip report - and had one of the best flights I've ever taken.  One of the most comfortable economy class seats I've ever flown on - and free hot drinks/snacks on a 50 minute flight made this a fantastic flight.  The wonderful crew were the icing on the cake! \n\nWatch the trip report and tell me what you think - and please don't forget to subscribe for weekly videos!\n\nAirline: LOT Polish Airlines\nFlight: LO766\nAircraft: Embraer 195 SP-LNF\nFrom: Lvov (LWO)\nTo: Warsaw (WAW)\nDeparture: 15:45\nArrival: 15:25\nFlight Time: 0:40\nSeat: 25D\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

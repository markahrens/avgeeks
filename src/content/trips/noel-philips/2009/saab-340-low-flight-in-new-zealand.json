 "name": "Saab 340 Low Flight in New Zealand",
 "description": "After departure from Nelson en-route to Auckland, the captain of our Air New Zealand Saab 340 announced that as we were running a few minutes early and it was such a beautiful day, he'd take us for a bit of sightseeing before we continued our flight north.  We flew just off the Marlborough coastline, passing Ohana, French Pass and D'urville island before climbing to cruise altitude and continuing our flight.\r\n\r\nVisit my website at www.aviationphotos.co.uk for more videos and photos.\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

 "description": "Full length, full flight video onboard SAS/Cimber Air Bombardier CRJ200 OY-RJK, operating flight SK679 from Copenhagen (CPH) to Berlin Tegel (TXL) on 2 February 2015.  \n\n*Every minute of the flight included from gate to gate*\n\nThe video begins at the gate in Copenhagen, with boarding via the front steps.  We soon start up our engines, and immediately head for the deicing bay where we are de-iced.  Then we continue our taxi to runway 22R, making a sporty takeoff to the south.  We climb to our cruising altitude of 25,000ft for our short cruise across the Baltic Sea to the German coast, after which we descend through the clouds towards Berlin, where it is again overcast.  We make our approach to runway 26R, touching down a few minutes ahead of schedule.  The video ends with deboarding and a short bus ride to the terminal.\n\nVideo taken from seat 12A.\n\nAirline:  SAS Scandinavian Airlines (Cimber Air)\nFlight:  SK679\nAircraft:  Bombardier CRJ200 OY-RJK\nFrom:  Copenhagen (CPH)\nTo:  Berlin Tegel (TXL)\nDeparture:  14:40\nArrival:  15:30\nFlight Time:  00:50\nSeat:  12A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/xJRI6o\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

 "name": "How to Fly to the USA from Europe in 2021",
 "description": "It's August 2021, and 18 months on the US Travel Ban means it's still closed to most non Americans arriving from the UK, Europe, Brazil and China. Here's how, with a little extra time on our hands, we are still able to visit the USA.\n\nPlease note: Since filming this video, Mexico has been placed on the UK's red list - so we wouldn't necessarily recommend Mexico for the 2 week wait right now.  With Canada opening, that is probably your best option at the moment.\n\nOFFICIAL NOEL MERCH: www.noelphilips.com\nJOIN ME ON WHATSAPP, GET WEEKLY LIVE CHATS AND MUCH MORE - SUPPORT ME ON PATREON! http://patreon.com/inflightvideo",

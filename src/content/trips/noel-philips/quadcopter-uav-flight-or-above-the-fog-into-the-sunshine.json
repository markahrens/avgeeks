 "description": "Ok so here's something a little different for you!  I took my quadcopter UAV up from the ground on a very foggy morning this weekend into the brilliant clear blue skies above, to get a view from a few hundred feet up!\n\nWhat do you think to me sharing more of my flights like this on here in addition to the commercial flights I take, would you like to see more?  Please drop me a comment in the comments section below, or vote on the video!",

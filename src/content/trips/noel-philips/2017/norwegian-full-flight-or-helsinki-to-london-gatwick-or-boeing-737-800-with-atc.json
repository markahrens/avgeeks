We walk to the gate and are soon called for boarding of this afternoon's flight to London Gatwick.  We board a bus and are taken to a remote gate where we board our aircraft that will take us to London.  \n\nWe are soon cleared to start and pushback, and begin our taxi to the runway.  We are delayed slightly due to a technical fault with the aircraft's computers, but after a hold of around 10 minutes we are on our way again, and make a beautiful departure from Helsinki.  \n\nWe fly across Finland and Sweden, hitting a spot of turbulence as we climb away from Helsinki.  We cross Northern Germany and the Netherlands before crossing the North Sea towards the UK.  We commence our descent towards London and make a beautiful sunset approach, touching down on runway 08L on a gorgeous autumn evening.  We disembark the aircraft and exit the terminal.\n\n0:00:08 Inside Helsinki Airport walking to gate 50C\n0:06:32 At gate 50C waiting to board aircraft\n0:10:21 Boarding bus to aircraft\n0:11:32 Bus ride to aircraft\n0:16:04 Boarding aircraft, taking seat in 7F\n0:22:54 Cabin view\n0:25:46 Cabin view\n0:33:18 Safety briefing\n0:34:45 Pushback, engine start\n0:38:15 ATC: Taxi clearance\n0:40:38 Holding to restart flight computers\n0:54:44 Commencing taxi to runway 04R\n0:56:53 Line up on runway 04R\n0:58:31 Take off clearance, takeoff runway 04R\n0:59:39 Flight map commences\n1:06:27 Cabin view\n1:08:48 Turbulence\n1:10:03 Cabin view\n1:41:48 Cabin view\n2:35:23 Cabin view\n3:18:57 ATC: Contacting Gatwick Approach, commencing approach\n3:32:44 Final approach to Gatwick\n3:36:32 Landing runway 08R at Gatwick\n3:46:49 Disembarking aircraft, walk through terminal to kerb\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

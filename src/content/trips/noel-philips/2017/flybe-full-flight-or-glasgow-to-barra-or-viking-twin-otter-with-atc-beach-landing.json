We enter the terminal and head through security, before heading to the Loganair gates.\n\nBefore long we are called to board and make our way out to today's ride - Viking Twin Otter G-HIAL.  We board and take our seat in row 6 on this tiny aircraft.  We soon get ATC clearance to power back and taxi to runway 23, where we make a powerful departure towards the west climbing out over the River Clyde.  Glasgow Departure clears us to our cruising altitude of 6,000ft and we head towards the Scottish coast.  We are soon over the sea and commence our unique approach into Barra, swinging round over the island and touching down smoothly on the sandy beach, splashing through giant pools of water before we come to a halt and shut down the engines.\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",

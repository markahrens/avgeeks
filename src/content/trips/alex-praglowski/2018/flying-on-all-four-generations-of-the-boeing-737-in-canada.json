 "name": "FLYING ON ALL FOUR GENERATIONS OF THE BOEING 737 IN CANADA!",
 "description": "At the start of 2018, I booked a return trip on Canadian North Airlines between Edmonton and Yellowknife to fly on their 737-200. Later in the year, I saw some great deals on Flair Airlines between Calgary and Winnipeg on their 737-400. With that, I made a goal to fly on all four generations (Original, Classic, Next Generation, MAX) in 2018, and I managed to do just that. See what it's like to fly on every generation of the world's best-selling airliner!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

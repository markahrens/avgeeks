 "name": "Italian Air Force Boeing KC-767 Tanker Close Up Departure from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Every summer, generally during the first week of July, NATO troops come to Calgary to train at Suffield, a Canadian Forces Base southeast of Calgary. The French, Belgian, and German Air Forces already came and went this year, but this Italian Air Force KC-767 was a pretty unique visitor! Here we have MM62229 taxiing out from Apron 6 and departing runway 35L heading back to Europe. I didn't hear what airport they were cleared to unfortunately, but I hope you enjoy this military 767 up close, with ATC included!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION \nAirline: Italian Air Force/Aeronautica Militare (IAM) \nAircraft: Boeing 767-2EY(ER)/KC-767A (B762) \nFlight Number: IAM1431 \nAircraft Name: None \nLivery: Standard Grey \nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B7F \nRegistration: MM62229 - 14-04 \nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Unknown\nCallsign: ITALIAN AIR FORCE 1431 heavy \nRunway used: 35L \nDate filmed: July 6, 2018 \nLocal time: 1900 \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

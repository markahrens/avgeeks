 "description": "I've been focusing more on my trip reports lately instead of dedicated takeoff/landing videos like this one, but I think the engine sound from this departure was too good to not post as its own video! Here we have C-FLKX, an Airbus A321-200, operating Air Canada flight 140 to Toronto spooling up and taking off from Calgary International Airport in July 2018. Hope you enjoy this engine buzzsaw as much as I did filming it!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Airbus A321-211 (A321)\nFlight Number: AC140\nSeat: 12A\nAircraft Name: None \nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-5B3/P \nRegistration: C-FLKX\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Toronto-Pearson (YYZ)\nCallsign: AIR CANADA 140\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: July 2018\nLocal time: 1000\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

 "name": "TRIP REPORT | Flair Airlines Boeing 737-400 (PLUS SEATS) Calgary to Winnipeg",
 "description": "The Ultra-Low Cost Carrier (ULCC) market is starting to heat up in Canada. Flair Airlines is one of the players in this market, founded in 2005 as a charter carrier, but becoming a scheduled carrier in 2017 after purchasing NewLeaf Travel, a virtual airline that sold tickets using Flair aircraft. Since then, Flair has transformed themselves into their own ULCC, currently serving 10 destinations across Canada with a fleet of Boeing 737-400 aircraft. I've seen mixed reviews about Flair, so once I saw a good deal from Calgary, I jumped on it to check out the Flair experience and to fly on a 737-400, another aircraft type I've never flown on. Enjoy this trip report on one of Canada's newer airlines, from Calgary, Alberta to Winnipeg, Manitoba!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVIDEO LOG\n00:05 - Pre-Security\n01:35 - Post-Security\n03:00 - At the gate\n06:15 - Boarding\n13:55 - In Flight\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Flair Airlines (FLE/F8)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-490 (B734)\nFlight Number: F8136\nSeat: 6A\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-3C1 \nRegistration: C-FLHE\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Winnipeg (YWG)\nCallsign: FLAIR 136\nRunway used: 35R (YYC) - 31 (YWG)\nDate filmed: July 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

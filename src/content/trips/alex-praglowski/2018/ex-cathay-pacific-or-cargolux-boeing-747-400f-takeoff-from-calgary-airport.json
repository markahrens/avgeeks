 "description": "Cathay's not completely gone from Calgary in a way! This former Cathay Pacific Cargo Boeing 747-400F, now operated by Cargolux, is a fairly common visitor to YYC lately. Filmed back in August (as evidenced by the lack of snow on the ground and abundance of smoke) is LX-ICL, a Boeing 747-400F wearing a basic Cathay Pacific Cargo livery taxiing up close on Alpha and departing runway 35L for Luxembourg. Always a treat to see a 747 here, even if it's a reminder of what once was! ATC is included, enjoy.

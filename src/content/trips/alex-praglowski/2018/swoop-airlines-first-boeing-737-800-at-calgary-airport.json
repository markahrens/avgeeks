 "name": "Swoop Airlines' FIRST Boeing 737-800 at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Canada's newest ultra-low-cost carrier, Swoop Airlines, is a subsidiary of WestJet created specifically for the ultra-low-cost market in Canada, and to compete with other startup ULCCs like Canada Jetlines and Flair Airlines. Here we have their first painted aircraft, a 737-800 from WestJet in a high density 189-seat configuration. It was painted and its cabin reconfigured in Kelowna (YLW) before being flown to WestJet's HQ here in Calgary, and it's been hiding in a hangar until today, when I managed to luck out and see it out in the open. Flights are scheduled to start between Edmonton, Hamilton, Winnipeg, and Abbotsford in late June. Enjoy this quick look around the first aircraft of Canada's latest airline!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

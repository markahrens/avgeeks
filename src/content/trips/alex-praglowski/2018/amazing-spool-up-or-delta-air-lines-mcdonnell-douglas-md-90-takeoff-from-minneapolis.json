 "name": "AMAZING SPOOL UP! | Delta  Air Lines McDonnell-Douglas MD-90 Takeoff from Minneapolis!",
 "description": "Jump to 09:15 for the engine spool-up! Here we have my first flight on a McDonnell-Douglas-designated aircraft. The MD-90 is a stretched version of the venerable MD-80 series with updated engines, which sound incredible on takeoff! This was a two hour hop down to the world's busiest airport, Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson. Even though it was great to finally fly a true McDonnell-Douglas designated aircraft, the flight was less than great, and you'll see why in my upcoming trip report of this flight. For now, sit back, relax, and enjoy the great sound on this departure!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Delta Air Lines (DAL/DL)\nAircraft: McDonnell-Douglas MD-90-30 (MD90)\nFlight Number: DL1481\nSeat: 35E\nAircraft Name: None \nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x IAE V2525-D5 \nRegistration: N952DN\nRoute: Minneapolis-Saint Paul (MSP) - Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson (ATL)\nCallsign: Delta 1481 \nRunway used: 17\nDate filmed: March 2018\nLocal time: 1500\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dude8472productionsYT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

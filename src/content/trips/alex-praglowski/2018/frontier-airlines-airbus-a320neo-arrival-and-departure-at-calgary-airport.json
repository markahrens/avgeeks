 "name": "Frontier Airlines Airbus A320neo Arrival and Departure at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Great to see the A320neo back here in Calgary! As one of the largest operators of the neo in North America with 10 neos in the fleet (at the time of uploading), it was inevitable that Calgary would see some of these birds on Frontier's first international route. Here we have N310FR, otherwise known as Sunny The Collared Lizard, arriving on 17L and then taxiing up close for departure again on 17L for Denver. ATC is included, enjoy this colourful neo!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Frontier Airlines (FFT/F9)\nAircraft: Airbus A320-251N (A20N)\nFlight Number: F9107/106\nAircraft Name: Sunny The Collared Lizard\nLivery: New (2014) \nEngines: 2x CFMI LEAP-1A26 \nRegistration: N310FR\nRoute: Denver (DEN) - Calgary (YYC) - Denver (DEN)\nCallsign: FRONTIER FLIGHT 107/106\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: June 3rd, 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

 "name": "WestJet Boeing 767-300ER(WL) Smoky Arrival at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Despite having been around for almost 3 years now, it's always nice seeing one of WestJet's four widebodies! That number is soon to grow though, with their first 787-9 having rolled out of final assembly at Paine Field in the past few days. Can't wait to see it here in January! In the meantime, here's WestJet's first 767 arriving on a typical Gatwick-Calgary flight in August, in the midst of some heavy smoke from forest fires in British Columbia. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nI appreciate all of the support lately! If you've seen my latest posts on Twitter and Instagram, you'll have guessed that I have some exciting content coming up in the next few weeks from California... Stay tuned :)\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-338ER (B763)\nFlight Number: WS2\nAircraft Name: 671\nLivery: Modified (2015-2018)\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B6 \nRegistration: C-FOGJ\nRoute: London-Gatwick (LGW) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WESTJET 2 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: August 2018\nLocal time: 1400\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

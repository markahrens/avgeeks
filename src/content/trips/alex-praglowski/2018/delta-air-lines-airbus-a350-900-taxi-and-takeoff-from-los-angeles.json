 "description": "Despite being in commercial service for 3 years now, this is actually my first time filming an Airbus A350! Delta became the first American operator of the A350 just over a year ago, with this exact aircraft, N501DN, seen here departing Los Angeles International Airport for Shanghai as \"Delta 89 heavy\". The A350's definitely grown on me since we first saw it, those winglets look fantastic! Glad to have finally filmed one.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Delta Air Lines (DAL/DL)\nAircraft: Airbus A350-941 (A359)\nFlight Number: DL89\nLivery: New\nEngines: 2x RR Trent XWB-84 \nRegistration: N501DN\nRoute: Los Angeles (LAX) - Shanghai (PVG)\nCallsign: DELTA 89 heavy\nRunway used: 25R\nDate filmed: November 2018\nLocal time: 1400\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nAir Traffic Control communications via LiveATC.net.\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

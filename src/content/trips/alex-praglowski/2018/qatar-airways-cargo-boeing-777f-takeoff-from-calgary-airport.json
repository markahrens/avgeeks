 "description": "The summer equestrian charters have begun! A few times a summer, show jumping horses are brought in from all around the world for events at Spruce Meadows, a venue south of Calgary, and this particular flight brought some of the horses for the \"North American\" from Europe, and is seen here departing for Chicago after dropping off said horses. Always great to see this special 777F here! ATC is included, hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Qatar Airways Cargo (QTR/QR)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-FDZ (B77F)\nFlight Number: QR8191\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE90-110B1L\nRegistration: A7-BFF\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Chicago-O'Hare (ORD)\nCallsign: QATARI 8191 heavy\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: June 4, 2018\nLocal time: 1900\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

 "name": "Delta Air Lines McDonnell-Douglas MD-90 GORGEOUS Sunset Arrival in Atlanta!",
 "description": "The MD-90 is a stretched version of the venerable MD-80 series with updated engines, and this was my first flight on one! This two hour hop down to Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson was on board N952DN, a 1998-built MD-90 that initially flew with Japan Airlines before being acquired by Delta in 2012. It was great to finally add an MD-90 to my flight log, and this arrival came with some incredible lighting! Hope you enjoy this approach and landing into the world's busiest airport.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Delta Air Lines (DAL/DL0\nAircraft: McDonnell-Douglas MD-90-30 (MD93)\nFlight Number: DL1481\nSeat: 35E\nAircraft Name: None \nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x IAE V2525-D5\nRegistration: N952DN\nRoute: Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) - Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson (ATL)\nCallsign: Delta 1481 \nRunway used: 26R\nDate filmed: March 2018\nLocal time: 1900\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dude8472productionsYT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

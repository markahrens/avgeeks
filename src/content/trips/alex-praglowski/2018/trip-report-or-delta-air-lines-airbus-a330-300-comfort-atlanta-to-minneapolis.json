 "name": "TRIP REPORT | Delta Air Lines Airbus A330-300 (COMFORT+) Atlanta to Minneapolis",
 "description": "The latest installment in my series of trip reports on Delta Air Lines, but on a heavy for once! N803NW, a former Northwest Airlines Airbus A330-300, took me on what may have been the most relaxing flight of this series in Delta Comfort+, the US carrier's Economy Plus offering. Fun fact - I wasn't actually supposed to be on this flight. Thanks to the 2 hour delay on my Huntsville to Atlanta leg, I ended up missing what would have been my first 757 flight and was rebooked on this A330 instead. Not a bad consolation prize! I hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Delta Air Lines (DAL/DL)\nAircraft: Airbus A330-323 (A333)\nFlight Number: DL1934\nSeat: 12A\nAircraft Name: None \nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney PW4168A \nRegistration: N803NW\nRoute: Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson (ATL) - Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP)\nCallsign: DELTA 1934 heavy \nRunway used: 26L (ATL) - 12R (MSP)\nDate filmed: March 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

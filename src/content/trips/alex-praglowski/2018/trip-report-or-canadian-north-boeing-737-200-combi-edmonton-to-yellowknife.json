 "name": "TRIP REPORT | Canadian North Boeing 737-200 COMBI Edmonton to Yellowknife",
 "description": "Canadian North is an airline that operates vital services for people in two of Canada's territories, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and they happen to operate a particularly unique aircraft out of Edmonton to Yellowknife on Mondays - the Boeing 737-200 Combi! At the end of June, a fellow enthusiast and I took a day trip up to the capital of the Northwest Territories to experience this classic aircraft and visit one of the largest cities in Canada's North. This trip has been something that's been on my bucket list for a while, and I'm so happy to be able to cross it off! This trip report consists of the first half of the journey, from Edmonton International Airport to Yellowknife Airport on a 38-year-old 737-200 Combi, C-GOPW. Hope you enjoy this unique trip report!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVIDEO LOG: \n00:05 - Pre-Security \n01:30 - Post-Security \n03:00 - At The Gate \n04:45 - Boarding \n07:30 - Takeoff \n14:00 - Landing \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Canadian North (MPE/5T)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-275C(Adv) (B732)\nFlight Number: 5T438\nSeat: 15A\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17\nRegistration: C-GOPW\nRoute: Edmonton (YEG) - Yellowknife (YZF)\nCallsign: EMPRESS 438\nRunway used: 12 (YEG) / 34 (YZF)\nDate filmed: June 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nMusic is \"Peace of Mind\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

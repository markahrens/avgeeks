 "name": "TRIP REPORT | Air Canada Boeing 767 SIGNATURE CLASS Warsaw to Toronto",
 "description": "In April, Air Canada rebranded their International Business Class service as \"Signature Class\", which involved a number of upgrades to their existing premium cabin, such as the addition of mattress pads and updated food and drink choices on top of award-winning service.\n\nOn Air Canada's Boeing 767-300ERs, some of which are over 25 years old, Air Canada's Signature Class cabin features their Classic Pod in a 1-1-1 configuration. Knowing that the 767s would be retiring soon, (and that my knees would much appreciate it) I decided to pay a bit extra for Business Class and the Signature Service from Warsaw, Poland to Toronto, Canada, and what a great flight it was!\n\nWhat do you think of Air Canada's 767 Signature Class? Hope you enjoy this trip report on this soon-to-be-retired aircraft.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVIDEO LOG:\n00:40 - At the gate\n01:00 - LOT's 'Mazurek' lounge\n04:00 - Boarding\n06:00 - Seat details\n10:00 - Takeoff\n14:00 - First meal service\n16:00 - Amenity kit\n16:30 - Lie-flat mode\n20:00 - Second meal service\n21:30 - Landing\n24:30 - De-boarding comments\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-375/ER (B763)\nFlight Number: AC827\nSeat: 6A\nAircraft Name: 641\nLivery: 2005-2017\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B6F \nRegistration: C-GLCA\nRoute: Warsaw-Chopin (WAW) - Toronto-Pearson (YYZ)\nCallsign: AIR CANADA 827 heavy\nRunway used: 33 (WAW) - 24L (YYZ)\nDate filmed: August 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

 "name": "Diversion! Air Canada New Livery 777-300ER First Visit at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Air Canada's new livery on the 777-300ER is stunning! Here we have Calgary's first ever visit from an AC 77W in their new livery, as a diversion en route from Shanghai to Toronto. The aircraft had a 5 hour delay leaving Shanghai and the crew must have timed out, hence the diversion to Calgary for a crew swap. A long day for those passengers yesterday. Here we have Air Canada's oldest 777-300ER arriving on runway 35L with an interesting ATC exchange (they really did call tower that late, no editing involved), and then later being repositioned to a domestic gate, as all the passengers had to deplane and go through customs in Calgary. Hope you enjoy my first shot of Air Canada's largest aircraft in their new livery!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-333/ER (B77W)\nFlight Number: AC028\nAircraft Name: 731 \nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x GE90-115B\nRegistration: C-FITL\nRoute: Shanghai Pudong (PVG) - diverted to Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Air Canada 028 heavy\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: May 4, 2018\nLocal time: 1830\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dude8472productionsYT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

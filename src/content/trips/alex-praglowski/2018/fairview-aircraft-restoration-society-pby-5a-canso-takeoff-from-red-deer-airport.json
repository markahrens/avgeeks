 "name": "Fairview Aircraft Restoration Society PBY-5A Canso Takeoff from Red Deer Airport",
 "description": "Please take a look at the Fairview Aircraft Restoration Society's website and consider making a donation to keep this magnificent aircraft flying: www.savethecanso.com\n\nThis PBY-5A Canso, a Canadian-built version of the PBY Catalina, a flying boat used during World War II, paid Red Deer a visit on Sunday May 27th for the \"Props and Pistons\" event held by YQF. In the days leading up to the event, I heard that this unique bird was going to be there, and needless to say, I wanted to catch it! Here we have Canso FNJE starting up, taxiing, and departing Red Deer Regional Airport on runway 17 for its home base in Fairview, Alberta, some 500 kilometers northwest of Red Deer. This is certainly one of the more unique aircraft that I've filmed, hope you enjoy this special catch!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAircraft: Canadian Vickers PBY-5A Canso\nLivery: Buffalo Airways \nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92\nRegistration: C-FNJE\nRoute: Red Deer Regional (YQF) - Fairview (CEB5)\nCallsign: Foxtrot November Juliet Echo\nRunway used: 17\nDate filmed: May 27, 2018\nLocal time: 1700\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

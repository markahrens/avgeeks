 "name": "Edelweiss Air Airbus A340-300 Dusk Takeoff from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Edelweiss Air is by far my favourite summer seasonal visitor! With all the 787s and A330s that Calgary sees, their A340 certainly stands out. Here we have HB-JME departing Calgary for Zurich a little over a month ago, just after sunset. Their final flight for the season is fast approaching, in just a week from now. Can't wait to see them back next year! ATC is included, hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Edelweiss Air (EDW/WK) \nAircraft: Airbus A340-313 (A343)\nFlight Number: WK15\nAircraft Name: \"Pilatus\"\nLivery: New\nEngines: 4x CFMI CFM56-5C4/P \nRegistration: HB-JME\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Zurich (ZRH)\nCallsign: EDELWEISS 15 Juliet heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: August 12, 2018\nLocal time: 2100\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

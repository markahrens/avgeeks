 "name": "WestJet NEW LIVERY Boeing 737 MAX 8 First Ever Landing at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Last month, WestJet revealed a new livery and brand identity in preparation for the delivery of their first Boeing 787 in 2019, and will be slowly rolling out the new livery on their existing aircraft. In the meantime, all new 737 MAX deliveries will have the new paint job, and this is the very first aircraft to wear this sharp looking livery. I personally love it, I think WestJet nailed it with this new look! ATC is included, hope you enjoy the new livery landing at WestJet's home base of Calgary International Airport for the first time!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737 MAX 8 (B38M)\nFlight Number: WS8964\nAircraft Name: None \nLivery: New (2018)\nEngines: 2x CFMI LEAP-1B\nRegistration: C-FNWD\nRoute: Boeing Field (BFI) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WESTJET 8964\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: June 21, 2018\nLocal time: 1620\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

 "name": "Royal Canadian Air Force CF-188B Hornet Close Up Departure from Calgary",
 "description": "Always great to catch a fighter jet at a civilian airport! Here we have 188937, one of several two-seater McDonnell-Douglas CF-18s the Royal Canadian Air Force has in service, starting up and taxiing out super close up, and making an ear-splitting departure off 35L. Calgary sees a few CF-18s this time of year thanks to Stampede, and I'm glad I was able to catch one of them! Hope you enjoy this close up CF-18 action, with ATC included!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nOperator: Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF/ARC)\nAircraft: McDonnell-Douglas CF-188B Hornet\nLivery: Standard Grey\nEngines: 2× General Electric F404-GE-400\nRegistration: 188937 \nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: KUGR24\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: July 14, 2018\nLocal time: 1000\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

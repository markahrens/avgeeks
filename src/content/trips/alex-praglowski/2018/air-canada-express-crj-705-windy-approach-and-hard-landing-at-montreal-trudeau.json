 "description": "Back in Canada from my trip to D.C.! Here we have my view on board AC8827 from Washington Reagan National to Montreal-Trudeau International Airport back in July of 2017. It was a great flight as usual with Air Canada, and the extra legroom of the CRJ-705 is seriously fantastic. Some menacing clouds on approach as well as some high winds, but the crew did an excellent job of getting us on the ground safely.

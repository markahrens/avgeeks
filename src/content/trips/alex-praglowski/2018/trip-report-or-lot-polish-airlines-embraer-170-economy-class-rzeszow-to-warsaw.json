 "description": "My first trip report on LOT! SP-LDG, one of LOT's many Embraer regional jets flew me from the largest city in southeast Poland to the capital city in Warsaw. Like Lufthansa's CRJ, I've flown this route quite a few times, but this was the first time I've documented the experience instead of just filming out the window. But, unlike Lufthansa, you won't actually see me complaining about the legroom in this one!

 "description": "The Bombardier Global 7500 is a new ultra-long-range business jet developed by Canada's Bombardier Aerospace, has recently completed flight testing and is now awaiting certification. It's capable of transporting 19 people over 14,000km (according to Bombardier) with a top cruising speed of Mach 0.925. Prior to certification, much like the CSeries a few years prior, it's been on some route proving flights, including this stop in Calgary! It came from Ottawa and departed an hour later for Vancouver, making this the first ever visit of a Global 7500 in Calgary! It's also my first time seeing this new business jet, and what a gorgeous aircraft it is! ATC is included, hope you enjoy this brand new bird in action!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nOperator: Bombardier Aerospace (BBA)\nAircraft: Bombardier Global 7500 (GL7T)\nFlight Number: BBA704\nAircraft Name: FTV4 \nLivery: Demonstrator\nEngines: 2x GE Passport\nRegistration: C-GLBR\nRoute: Ottawa (YOW) - Calgary (YYC) - Vancouver (YVR)\nCallsign: BOMBARDIER 704\nRunway used: 35R/35L\nDate filmed: August 26, 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

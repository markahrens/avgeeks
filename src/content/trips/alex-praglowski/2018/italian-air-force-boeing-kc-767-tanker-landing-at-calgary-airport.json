 "description": "YYC has turned into an Air Force Base again! Every summer, NATO troops come to Calgary to train at Suffield, a Canadian Forces Base southeast of Calgary. We've received some unique visitors already from the French, Belgian, and German Air Forces, but this Italian 767 is a new sight for us in Calgary! Enjoy this KC-767, a modified Boeing 767-200ER that can be used as a transport aircraft as well as an air-to-air tanker! ATC is included. \n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Italian Air Force/Aeronautica Militare (IAM)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-2EY(ER)/KC-767A (B762)\nFlight Number: IAM1431\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard Grey\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B7F \nRegistration: MM62229 - 14-04\nRoute: Unknown - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: ITALIAN AIR FORCE 1431 heavy\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: July 5, 2018\nLocal time: 1830\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

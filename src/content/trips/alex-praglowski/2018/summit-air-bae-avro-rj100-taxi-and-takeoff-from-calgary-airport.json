 "description": "Summit Air is a Canadian airline headquartered in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories that operates a diverse fleet of ATRs, Dorniers, Twin Otters, Dash 8s, and Avro RJs. Summit flies their Avro RJs into Calgary on mining charters a few times a week, but I've never been lucky enough to catch one! Here we have C-FXRJ, a 21-year-old example of this British airliner taxiing past on Delta and taking off from runway 17L, heading up north to Yellowknife. ATC is included, and thanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Summit Air (SUM/SU)\nAircraft: Avro RJ100 (RJ1H)\nFlight Number: SU8021\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x LY LF507-1F \nRegistration: C-FXRJ \nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Yellowknife (YZF)\nCallsign: SUMMIT 8021\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: December 20, 2018\nLocal time: 1000\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

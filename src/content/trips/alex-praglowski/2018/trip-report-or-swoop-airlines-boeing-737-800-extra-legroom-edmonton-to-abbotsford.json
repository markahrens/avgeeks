 "name": "TRIP REPORT | Swoop Airlines Boeing 737-800 (EXTRA LEGROOM) Edmonton to Abbotsford",
 "description": "Swoop Airlines is one of two new carriers in Canada offering ultra-low cost flights between 5 airports in Canada, and soon adding 5 new destinations in the United States for the winter season. Swoop is a subsidiary of WestJet, was created in 2017, and started operations just a few months ago with high-density Boeing 737-800s aircraft transferred from their parent company. After finding a great round trip deal that I couldn't pass up, I decided to try them from Edmonton to Abbotsford (as they don't fly from Calgary), paying a little bit extra for one of their extra legroom seats, which you'll soon see were absolutely worth it! Hope you enjoy this new trip report on Canada's newest airline.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVIDEO LOG\n02:10 - At the gate\n03:20 - Boarding\n06:30 - Takeoff\n08:45 - In Flight\n12:30 - Landing\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Swoop Airlines (WSW/WO)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-800 (B738)\nFlight Number: WO121\nSeat: 7F\nAircraft Name: #Abbotsford\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-7B27E \nRegistration: C-FPLS\nRoute: Edmonton International (YEG) - Abbotsford (YXX)\nCallsign: SWOOP 121\nRunway used: 02 (YEG) - 25 (YXX)\nDate filmed: September 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

 "description": "My first trip report on Lufthansa! D-ACNO, one of Lufthansa CityLine's many Bombardier CRJ-900s flew me from the airline's second largest hub in Munich, Germany, to Rzeszów, Poland, the largest city in the country's southeast region. I've flown Lufthansa CityLine CRJs a couple times, as you can see in some of my older videos, but this was my first time documenting the experience as well as flying on one of their CRJ-900s. Lufthansa has outfitted their CR9s with the maximum number of seats possible, 90. If you've watched any of my previous trip reports, I'm sure you can guess what I thought of the legroom ;) Enjoy this European trip report! \n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVIDEO LOG\n02:15 - At the gate\n03:45 - Boarding\n07:45 - Takeoff\n09:15 - In Flight\n10:45 - Landing\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Lufthansa CityLine (CLH/CL)\nAircraft: Bombardier CRJ-900LR (CR9)\nFlight Number: LH1618\nSeat: 24F\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Old with old Eurowings tail\nEngines: 2x GE CF34-8C5 \nRegistration: D-ACNO\nRoute: Munich (MUC) - Rzeszów-Jasionka (RZE)\nCallsign: HANSALINE 1618\nRunway used: 08R (MUC) - 27 (RZE)\nDate filmed: July 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

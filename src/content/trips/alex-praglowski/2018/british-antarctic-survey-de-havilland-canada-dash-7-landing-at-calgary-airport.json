 "name": "British Antarctic Survey De Havilland Canada Dash 7 Landing at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "A special visitor! Every year, the British Antarctic Survey heads down to Antarctica for the southern summer, and with them comes a fleet of aircraft, including this very rare De Havilland Canada Dash 7! The BAS has a fleet of DHC-6 Twin Otters as well as this, their sole DHC-7. At the end of each Antarctic summer, the aircraft head back up north and most of them head to Calgary for maintenance, where the Twin Otters undergo maintenance at Calgary's Springbank Airport, and the Dash 7 goes to the International. For what purpose, I'm not entirely sure, but I've seen them unloading Twin Otter skis in past years. Glad to finally have filmed them! Enjoy this special arrival with ATC.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nOperator: British Antarctic Survey \nAircraft: De Havilland Canada DHC-7-110 Dash 7 (DHC7)\nFlight Number: N/A\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: British Antarctic Survey Red\nEngines: 4x Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-50\nRegistration: VP-FBQ \nRoute: Casper (CPR) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Victor Papa Foxtrot Bravo Quebec\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: April 4, 2018\nLocal time: 1230\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dude8472productionsYT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

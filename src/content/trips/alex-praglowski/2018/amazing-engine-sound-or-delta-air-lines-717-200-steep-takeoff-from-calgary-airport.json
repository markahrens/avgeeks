 "name": "AMAZING ENGINE SOUND! | Delta Air Lines 717-200 Steep Takeoff from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "My first time flying the 717, and also my first time flying Delta! Here we have N993AT, a 15-year-old Boeing 717 (or MD-95, if you're a McDonnell-Douglas purist like me) rocketing out of a very snowy Calgary bound for Minneapolis as Delta Flight 892! There's something unique about this takeoff, being that the pilots performed a static takeoff, meaning that they lined up, held the brakes while spooling up to 50% N1, and released them before throttling up more. It was certainly fun to experience! I'm also making a trip report of this whole flight, so stay tuned for that! Hope you enjoy my first \"Mad Dog\" flight.\n\nOn a more somber note, the YouTube aviation community has been hit with the loss of DCA spotter 99carnot. He was an amazing supporter of my channel from the very beginning, and will be sorely missed by all.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVIDEO LOG:\n00:12 - Some views of my 717 parked at the gate.\n00:30 - Now seated mright next to the engine we see someone brushing the snow out of the engine intake from a snowstorm that previous night.\n01:00 - De-icing begins with an application of Type I to get the snow off the wings.\n03:20 - Now for some Type IV fluid.\n04:05 - Pushback.\n05:05 - Engine start.\n07:00 - Taxi begins.\n11:10 - Lining up on 35R, pilots perform an incredible \"static takeoff\" with some great engine sound!\n12:30 - Reducing to climb thrust, flaps up.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Delta (DAL/DL)\nAircraft: Boeing 717-2BD (B712)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines:  2x BMW RR BR715 \nRegistration: N993AT\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP)\nSeat: 26A\nCallsign: Delta 892\nRunway used: 35R\nLocal Time: 0800\nDate Filmed: March 2018\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N993AT\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

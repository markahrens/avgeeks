 "name": "Korean Air Cargo 747-8F [HL7629] Stunning Sunrise Departure from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Korean Air Cargo is one of those semi-annual visitors here in Calgary that I've been hoping to catch ever since I first saw one pop up on FlightAware all the way back in 2013! Unfortunately, nearly every single flight that they've operated has arrived and departed in the middle of the night, until today! Here we have HL7629 departing on a charter to Japan right at sunrise, with some phenomenal lighting! Very happy to have finally caught this special (for Calgary) 747-8F here! ATC is included, hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Korean Air Cargo (KAL/KE)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-8B5(F) (B748)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x GEnx-2B67\nRegistration: HL7629\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Kitakyushu (KKJ)\nCallsign: Korean Air 9624 heavy\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: March 13, 2018\nLocal time: 0800\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/HL7629\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

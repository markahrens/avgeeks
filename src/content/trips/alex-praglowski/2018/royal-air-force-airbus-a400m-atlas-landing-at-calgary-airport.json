 "description": "Military season has begun! The Royal Air Force operates dozens of troop and cargo flights into Calgary International Airport throughout the summer, as they do a multitude of military exercises at CFB Suffield, a Canadian Forces Base south of Calgary. Here's my first catch of them this year, bringing some cargo on board this Airbus A400M - only my second time seeing one! I love the look of these birds, they're certainly unique.

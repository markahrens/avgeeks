 "description": "I'm back from yet another trip to Eastern Europe! You can expect a few new spotting videos from RZE as well as some new trip reports, the first of which I uploaded already. Stay tuned for more in the coming weeks!\n\nLater this year, Poland will celebrate 100 years as a state after being partitioned in the late 1700s and effectively ceasing to exist on a map until 1918 when it became the Second Polish Republic after the end of the First World War. As such, flag carrier LOT Polish Airlines has painted two aircraft in this patriotic livery, this Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, as well as a Boeing 737 MAX 8. Here we have the Dreamliner, SP-LSC, pushing back, taxiing, and departing Poland's largest city for a transatlantic flight to Chicago at the end of July. I personally think the livery looks fantastic! Enjoy this special catch.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: LOT Polish Airlines (LO/LOT)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (B789)\nFlight Number: LO3\nLivery: \"Proud of Poland's Independence/Dumni z Niepodległości Polski\"\nEngines: 2x RR Trent 1000\nRegistration: SP-LSC\nRoute: Warsaw-Chopin (WAW) - Chicago O'Hare (ORD)\nCallsign: LOT 3\nRunway used: 33\nDate filmed: July 2018\nLocal time: 1700\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

 "name": "Kenn Borek Air Basler BT-67 (Turbine DC-3) Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Kenn Borek Air is a Calgary-based airline which operates a number of unique charter flights all over the globe, notably, to Antarctica during the southern summer. They operate several DC-3 Turbines, or Basler BT-67s, along with a large fleet of De Havilland Twin Otters. The Basler BT-67 is a converted Douglas DC-3 that's been lengthened and re-engined with Pratt and Whitney turboprops.  Here we have C-GJKB, a DC-3T originally manufactured in 1944 departing Calgary for Lethbridge on a training flight, presumably in preparation for the southern summer's expedition to Antarctica in the coming months. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Kenn Borek Air (KBA/4K)\nAircraft: Basler BT-67/Douglas DC-3 Turbine\nFlight Number: 4K168T\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard (red)\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-67R\nRegistration: C-GJKB\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Lethbridge (YQL)\nCallsign: BOREK 168 Trainer\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: September 15, 2018\nLocal time: 1500\n\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

 "description": "And so ends my first 717 flight, seen here landing in Minneapolis after a two hour hop from Calgary! It was a great first flight on the 717, with a very windy approach and some great engine sounds from all the throttling up and down, along with some phenomenal sound on the landing roll from the reverse thrust. There'll be a trip report coming soon with the details of this flight, so stay tuned for that! Hope you enjoy this windy arrival into the Twin Cities.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVIDEO LOG:\n00:12 - Looking back at one of N993AT's BR715 engines.\n00:35 - Descending into Minneapolis.\n03:15 - Diving through the cloud layer.\n10:30 - Flaps begin extending, some wind gusts pushing us around.\n14:00 - Final approach with downtown Minneapolis in the background.\n16:00 - Short final.\n17:00 - Vacating runway 12L.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Delta (DAL/DL)\nAircraft: Boeing 717-2BD (B712)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines:  2x BMW RR BR715 \nRegistration: N993AT\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP)\nSeat: 26A\nCallsign: Delta 892\nRunway used: 12L\nLocal Time: 1130\nDate Filmed: March 2018\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N993AT\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dude8472productionsYT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

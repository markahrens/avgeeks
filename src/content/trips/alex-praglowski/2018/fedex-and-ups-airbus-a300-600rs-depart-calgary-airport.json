 "description": "It's not every day you see two A300s departing at the same time (except maybe in Memphis or Louisville)! Here we have two examples of Airbus' first widebody from Calgary's two major American couriers taxiing up close on Bravo and departing runway 17L for their respective destinations. Both crews waved as well! ATC is included, enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: UPS (UPS/5X) / FedEx (FDX/FX)\nAircraft: Airbus A300F4-622R(F) / Airbus A300B4-622R(F)\nFlight Number: 5X6491 / FX141\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney PW4158 (both)\nRegistration: N131UP / N728FD\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Louisville (SDF) / Calgary (YYC) - Memphis (MEM)\nCallsign: UPS 6491 heavy / FEDEX 141 heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: July 2018\nLocal time: 1800\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

 "name": "Dual View! WestJet 737-7CT Approach and Landing at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Back in August 2017, a good friend of mine flew to Hawaii and took some inflight videos for me to upload. On his arrival back in Calgary, I was there filming the landing, and decided to make another dual-view video, much like CYUL Plane Spotter and I made in 2016 when I landed in Montreal on a Lufthansa A330. ATC is included, hope you enjoy this inflight video from warmer times!\n\nSpecial thanks to @yyc_aviationphotography for the footage!

 "name": "Boeing 747-409(LCF) Dreamlifter [N249BA] Dusk Landing at Paine Field ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "A lot has changed at PAE since my last trip, namely the opening of the Dreamlifter Operations Center in late 2013. With that, all Dreamlifter arrivals now take a very close up taxiway to get to their parking positions at the DOC, as you'll see in the video. This video includes some ATC communications (from liveatc.net), the touchdown, rollout, and close up taxi on taxiway Kilo one. I've got much more content coming up from PAE, so stay tuned! \n\nI'm now on Twitter! Feel free to follow me: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\n\nThanks for watching!

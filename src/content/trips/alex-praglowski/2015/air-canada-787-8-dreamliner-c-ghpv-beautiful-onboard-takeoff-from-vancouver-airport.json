 "name": "Air Canada 787-8 Dreamliner [C-GHPV] Beautiful Onboard Takeoff from Vancouver Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Here it is, the departure of my very first flight onboard the 787 Dreamliner! The aircraft just so happened to be C-GHPV, the first Air Canada 787 I caught with my new camera at YYC in December (link below). This comprehensive, 17 minute video features some exterior shots of the aircraft from the Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge, the pushback, engine startup, taxi, takeoff, and climb onboard AC003 to Tokyo-Narita International Airport. \n\nThe flight itself was, quite honestly, one of the best I've ever been on. Though I couldn't sleep (which is the case for any avgeek on a new plane), the mood lighting and the cabin pressure allowed me to feel rested and able to function upon landing. The service was excellent as well, along with the brand new entertainment system.\n\nI highly recommend that you view the video with headphones to get the full 787 \"experience\" while watching. Enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

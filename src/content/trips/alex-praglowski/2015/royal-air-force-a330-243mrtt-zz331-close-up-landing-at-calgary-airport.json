 "name": "Royal Air Force A330-243MRTT [ZZ331] Close Up Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Nice to catch this rare bird again! Here we have the second of the RAF's nine-strong fleet of A330MRTTs landing close up on runway 17L and then taxiing off. This spot is undoubtedly one of my favorites at YYC for arrivals, though the fence obscures much of the landing rollout. Unfortunately there's no ATC in this, but I hope you'll still enjoy this quick video!\n\nThanks for watching!

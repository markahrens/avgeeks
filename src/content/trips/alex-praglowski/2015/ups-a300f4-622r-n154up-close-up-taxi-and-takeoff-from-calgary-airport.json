 "description": "Follow me on Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\nNice to see this classic bird (which isn't actually so classic; it was built in 2003) in Calgary. Our usual service from UPS is typically flown with a 767, though the A300 does come on weekends. Wasn't expecting to have one taxi close up while waiting for a National Airlines 747 (video below). Anyway, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

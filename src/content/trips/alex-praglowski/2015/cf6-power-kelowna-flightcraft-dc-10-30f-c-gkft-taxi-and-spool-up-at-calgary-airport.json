 "description": "Follow me on Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\nFlashback Friday! I was feeling nostalgic about the DC-10 and found this clip from January of this year. The video features C-GKFT taxiing close up, and then spooling up on 35L. The sound is one of the best I've caught, IMO. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this short video!\n\nThanks for watching!

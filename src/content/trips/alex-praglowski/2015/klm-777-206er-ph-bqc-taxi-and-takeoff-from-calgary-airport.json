 "description": "I finally made it out a couple days ago to catch KLM's Boeing 777, which currently operates seasonally to YYC (four times per week in summer 2015). Interestingly enough, Air Canada's flight to Frankfurt also departs right around the time that KLM does, and sometimes both will be heading out one after the other, as you'll see in the video. \n\nThe video itself includes a shot of the two heavies taxiing out, a timelapse of both lining up one after the other, and the full takeoff of KLM, all with ATC throughout. Apologies for any wind noise and the shakiness, it was windy out and I was on top of a hill, which didn't help matters. Regardless, I hope you enjoy this baby blue Dutch triple seven leaving YYC, with some great GE90 sound!\n\nThanks for watching!

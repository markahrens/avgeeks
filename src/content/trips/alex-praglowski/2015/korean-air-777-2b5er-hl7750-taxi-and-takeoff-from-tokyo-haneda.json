 "description": "My very first spotting video from Tokyo Haneda International Airport! Here we have HL7750, coincidentally the same Korean Air 777 I caught at YVR last fall, taxiing and climbing out from Tokyo Haneda Airport. This video was shot from the International Terminal Observation Deck, along with all my other Haneda ones. Sorry for any shakiness and the low quality on the climb out, I was zoomed in all the way and the heat haze didn't help matters. Regardless, without further ado, I hope you enjoy, and stay tuned for much, much more to come!\n\nThanks for watching!

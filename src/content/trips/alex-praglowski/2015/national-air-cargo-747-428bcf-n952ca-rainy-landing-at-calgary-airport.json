 "name": "National Air Cargo 747-428BCF [N952CA] Rainy Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Every year, around September, an event is held south of Calgary, known as the Spruce Meadows Masters, a horse jumping show with professionals from all over the world. As a result, YYC spotters are treated to this gorgeous 747 carrying a number of these horses from Europe. This video includes ATC with captions, the landing, close up taxi, and some views of the aircraft parked. In the past two years, the flight has arrived with some beautiful sunny weather, but that wasn't the case for 2015. I was absolutely soaked by the end of this trip, so I hope you enjoy ;)\n\nThanks for watching!

 "name": "First Visit! Air Canada Rouge 767-333ER(WL) [C-GHLQ] Dusk Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "In their (almost) three years of operations, Air Canada Rouge has never sent one of their Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to Calgary International Airport. That changed today when C-GHLQ operated RV1863, Calgary's daily service to Las Vegas, as a rare equipment swap, arriving in the last few minutes of light on runway 17L. Not only is this a first for YYC, but it's a first for me as well. Prior to today, this was the only aircraft from Air Canada that I had never seen before. This bird sure looks good with those 11 foot tall winglets. ATC is included with captions as usual, enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

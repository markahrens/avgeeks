 "name": "British Airways 787-8 [G-ZBJA] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "The 787 is one of the most graceful aircraft in the skies today, especially at night, with those immediately recognizable beacons. Here we have BA's daily flight to YYC departing back home to London Heathrow. Unfortunately, from February 10th, the 767-300ER will be placed back on the route until sometime in October, for unknown reasons. I still have tons of 787 footage I have not yet released, so rest assured, there will be more BA 787 videos to come.\n\nThis video features G-ZBJA taxiing close up on taxiway Romeo, with her RR engines humming and taking to the skies. ATC is included throughout with captions. Enjoy the video!\n\nAlso, I will be doing a channel update vlog sometime in the future, so if you have any channel related questions, feel free to leave them in the comments and I will answer them in the video.\n\nThanks for watching!

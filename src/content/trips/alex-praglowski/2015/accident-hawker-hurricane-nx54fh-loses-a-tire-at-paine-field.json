 "name": "Accident! Hawker Hurricane [NX54FH] Loses a Tire at Paine Field ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "After a practice for an airshow known as the Flying Heritage Collection SkyFair, this Hawker Hurricane from the Flying Heritage Collection touched down on runway 16R, nearly sustained a prop strike, and lost its right main tire, resulting in quite a bit of smoke and sparks. The pilot climbed out just fine (from the looks of it), and was welcomed by Paine Field fire crew and personnel from the Collection. \n\nThis video includes ATC from the LiveATC archives, the incident, a bit of the aftermath, and some slow motion shots of the incident at the end. Unfortunately, I was scheduled to go on my Boeing tour shortly thereafter and wasn't able to capture how they moved it off. Regardless, enjoy the video, and thanks for watching.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2015\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

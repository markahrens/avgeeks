 "description": "95 years, hard to believe an airline has been around for such a long time. I'll be looking forward to to whatever KLM comes up with for their 100th anniversary ;) Here we have another catch I've been waiting forever to get, PH-AOE, KLM's 5th A330 with the 95 years sticker applied it. It may be just a sticker, but we don't see many heavies with special liveries at YYC (aside from AC's Star Alliance planes), so this bird was great to see, even though the sticker is smaller than on any of KLM's other planes. Hopefully I'll be able to see it on PH-BQD this summer when we get their 777s again.\n\nSorry for the shakiness in the beginning portion of the video. I had just made it to the spot and had no time to set up my tripod for the taxi past, but was able to for the takeoff. Enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

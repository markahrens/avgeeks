 "name": "Qatar Airways Cargo 777-FDZ [A7-BFC] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Every year, several equestrian events are held at Spruce Meadows, a facility located to the south of Calgary. Several horses are brought in from all over the world, and needless to say, YYC gets some interesting visitors as a result of that. \n\nThis 777 freighter from Qatar Airways Cargo just so happened to be the same one that came in May, and thankfully came at a much more convenient time. The video includes some shots of the aircraft parked, extensive close up taxi footage with some great GE90 sound, and the takeoff itself. ATC is included as well with captions. Enjoy this rare visitor!\n\nThanks for watching!

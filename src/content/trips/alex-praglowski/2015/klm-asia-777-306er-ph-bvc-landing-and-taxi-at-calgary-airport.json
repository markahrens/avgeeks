 "name": "KLM Asia 777-306ER [PH-BVC] Landing and Taxi at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "The KLM 777-300ER returns yet again! Here we have PH-BVC (the same aircraft that came last year) landing and taxiing close up at Calgary International Airport, operating as an equipment change from the standard 777-200ER. ATC is included, and the sound of the thrust reversers engaging is audible as well, with that trademark GE90 whine. I apologize for the shakiness on the taxiing shots, the crew taxiied quicker than usual and I had less time to get to my location. Regardless, I hope you enjoy this quick shot of the mighty 77W!\n\nThanks for watching!

 "description": "On September 3rd, Air China Cargo launched a new route, Shanghai-Edmonton-Dallas, operated by a Boeing 777 Freighter. The flight operates 6 times a week, flying PVG-YEG-DFW on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and DFW-YEG-PVG on Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday. This one and a half year old example, B-2097, is seen arriving on runway 30 at 09:23 local time after her 10 hour flight from Shanghai, in some great morning light. I hope you enjoy the video (seeing as I spent 5 hours driving there and back to get it)!\n\nThanks for watching!

 "name": "Air China A330-243 [B-6536] Wet Landing at Vancouver Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Here's another new airline for me! This is Air China's 22nd A330-200, one of 49 total A330s in their fleet. Right after the AC 77W landing video was shot, ATC switched the runways around so it was nice to get a different perspective of this bird. Air China now uses a 77W on this flight, so that'll be nice to catch whenever I go back. ATC is included with captions throughout, and I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

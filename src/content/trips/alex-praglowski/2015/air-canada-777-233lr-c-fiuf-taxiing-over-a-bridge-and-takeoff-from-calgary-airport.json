 "description": "The taxiway R overpass in all its glory! Here we have C-FIUF, one of Air Canada's six Boeing 777-200LR aircraft operating AC 844 to Frankfurt. I've wanted to get a shot like this for a while, and finally got around to editing it together. The video includes ATC with captions, in addition to some amazing GE90 sound on the takeoff roll! Enjoy, fellow avgeeks.\n\nThanks for watching!

 "name": "First Flight! Vietnam Airlines 787-9 [VN-A862] RTO and Takeoff from Paine Field ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "My very first video of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner! Here we have Vietnam Airlines' second 787 performing a rejected takeoff test and then lifting off on its first flight, with lots of water spray! The aircraft has since been delivered. The 787-8 is already an amazing looking aircraft, but the dash 9 is so much more proportional. Add Vietnam Airlines' excellent updated livery to that, and you've got one nice looking airplane. Enjoy, fellow avgeeks!\n\nThanks for watching!

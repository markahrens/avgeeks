 "name": "Royal Air Force C-17A Globemaster III [ZZ178] Landing and Taxiing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "If there ever was a reason to make an impromptu trip to the airport, this is it! Here we have the eighth C-17 Globemaster III belonging to the Royal Air Force landing and taxiing at Calgary International Airport. Built in 2012, this bird appears to have been one of the very last aircraft to ever be built at McDonnell Douglas' facility in Long Beach. I nearly missed the landing, so that's why there's no approach footage. Regardless, I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

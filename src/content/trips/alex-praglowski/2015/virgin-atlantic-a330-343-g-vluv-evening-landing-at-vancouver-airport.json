 "name": "Virgin Atlantic A330-343 [G-VLUV] Evening Landing at Vancouver Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "My very first time seeing Virgin Atlantic, but also my final upload from Vancouver International Airport. Here we have G-VLUV, one of VS' ten Airbus A330s, operating VIR95 from Heathrow, back in October. This route has since ceased operations, so it was a priority for me to capture it while I was there. Landing ATC is included, and I hope you enjoy!\nThanks for watching!

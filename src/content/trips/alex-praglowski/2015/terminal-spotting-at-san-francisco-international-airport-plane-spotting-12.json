 "name": "Terminal Spotting at San Francisco International Airport (Plane Spotting #12) ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Here we have my twelfth plane spotting compilation, this one from San Fransico International Airport, featuring lots of aircraft from United Airlines and a now retired Air New Zealand 747-400 (This was shot in February 2014). I have to apologize for the low quality of this upload, all of these clips were taken with my old camera, and as you all know, my freehand filming is, well, abysmal. There's some pretty cool stuff in here like a United 747 still in the tulip livery so I figured I might as well upload it. My upcoming videos will be of much better quality. \n\nThanks for watching!

 "description": "The big blue Queen of the Skies at YYC! Here we have PH-CKC, One of KLM's 3 747-400F aircraft parked at, being de-iced, and taking off from Calgary International Airport, after dropping off some cars inbound from Stuttgart, Germany. This bird surprised a lot of YYC spotters, since nobody noticed it was coming into YYC until it was 10 minutes out and appeared to be descending into Calgary (FlightRadar24 showed the flight as \"Stuttgart (STR) - Not Available\" and there was no flight plan at all on FlightAware), so only the lucky individuals already out there were able to capture the landing in light. Sadly, I was not one of them, but I still went to get this beauty departing, and it turned out very well! So, without further ado, enjoy my very first shot of KLM Cargo.\n\nThanks for watching!

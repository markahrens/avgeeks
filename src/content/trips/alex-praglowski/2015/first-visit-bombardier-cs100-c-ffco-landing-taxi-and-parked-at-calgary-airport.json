 "name": "First Visit! Bombardier CS100 [C-FFCO] Landing, Taxi, and Parked at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Follow me on Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\nThis was completely unexpected! I had read an article in the morning before I caught this saying that Bombardier would be doing some route proving flights in the coming days. I didn't expect that the first one would be to Calgary, with the first production CS100 aircraft (otherwise known as FTV6). This is, I believe, the first time a CSeries has been in Western Canada. It certainly led for some interesting conversation with ATC asking \"what kind of plane are you?\" at one point. Shoutout to CYUL Plane Spotter for the heads up! \n\nThis video features the ATC on the arrival (with a nice welcome from the approach controller as he handed the aircraft off to tower), the landing, taxi into parking, and some views of the aircraft on the apron. Sorry for any shakiness, it was pretty cold out and I wasn't dressed well. Regardless, I'm very happy I got this first-time event, and I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

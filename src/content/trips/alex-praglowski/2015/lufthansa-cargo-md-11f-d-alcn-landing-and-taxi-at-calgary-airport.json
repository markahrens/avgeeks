 "description": "Follow me on Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\nIt's been two years since the appearance of this modern widebody tri-jet at Calgary International Airport, with the last visit being from a World Airways example in 2013. This bird just so happens to be the final MD-11 ever built, line number 646, and is still going strong at 15 years of age. She is seen here in this video making a typical MD-11 landing on runway 35R (in other words, bouncy), taxiing up close on Juliet and parked on the apron. ATC is included with captions as usual, and I've also rendered this video in 60fps. Enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

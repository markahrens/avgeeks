 "name": "Air Canada 787-8 Dreamliner [C-GHPV] GORGEOUS Sunset Landing at Tokyo Narita!",
 "description": "Probably the best lighting I've ever seen on arrival! Here is the approach and landing of AC003 from Vancouver into Tokyo-Narita International Airport. Watch as the pilots fight some wind on the approach, nail the landing, taxi past some interesting aircraft, all with some beautiful light :) The flight was great, and the lower cabin altitude really does make a difference. Again, like the takeoff video, I highly recommend that this be viewed with a good quality headset, and the video log can be seen below. Enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

 "name": "Hi Fly A340-313 [CS-TQM] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Ever since Lufthansa stopped flying here, the Airbus A340 is rarely seen at Calgary International Airport. This example, CS-TQM, is the airport's first visit from an Airbus A340 since 2013! After operating a charter for the RAF the previous day, this 20 year old A340-300 is seen here taking up most of runway 17R/35L on departure back to Brize Norton. ATC is included with captions, and I hope you enjoy!\n\nI'm now on Twitter! Feel free to follow me: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\n\nThanks for watching!

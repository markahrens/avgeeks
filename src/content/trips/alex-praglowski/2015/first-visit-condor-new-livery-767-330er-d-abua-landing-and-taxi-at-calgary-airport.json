 "description": "Condor's annual seasonal flight to Calgary just started up a few days ago, and already spotters here have been treated to the \"hearts for children\" livery (which I was unable to catch) and this, their first 767 with the new Thomas Cook Group livery. The video includes the landing and a close up taxi past. ATC is included for the landing portion, with captions! Enjoy the video of this 23 year old 767 looking like new.\n\nThanks for watching!

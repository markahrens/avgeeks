 "name": "Wings Over Springbank 2015 - An Aviation Music Video ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Wings Over Springbank was an airshow held at Calgary Springbank Airport (CYBW) on the 18th and 19th of July 2015. Featuring performances from \"Super Dave\" Mathieson, Marcus Paine, Brent Hanley, Bruce Evans, Bud and Ross Granley, the RCAF CF-18 demo jet, RCAF Skyhawks, and the Snowbirds, in addition to over 15 aircraft on static display, this airshow was action packed. Formerly known as the Airdrie Regional Airshow, it was moved to Springbank due to new airspace restrictions with the opening of YYC's new runway.\n\nThis aviation music video is comprised of clips from both days. I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

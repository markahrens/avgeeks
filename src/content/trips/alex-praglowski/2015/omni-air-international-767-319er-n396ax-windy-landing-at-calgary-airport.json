 "name": "Omni Air International 767-319ER [N396AX] Windy Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "New spot! Here we have an Omni Air International 767-300ER arriving at Calgary International Airport from San Antonio, operating a charter for TD Bank. I've gotta say, I think this video turned out pretty well even though it was super windy, windy enough to warrant the use of the crosswind runway, which is a pretty rare event. I just love that you can see the actual runway surface from here, there aren't many spots at YYC that allow that. ATC is included, but not the landing clearance unfortunately. Enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

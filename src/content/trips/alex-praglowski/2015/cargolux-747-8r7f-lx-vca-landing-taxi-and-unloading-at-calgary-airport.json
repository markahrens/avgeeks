 "description": "Hey everyone, for this video I decided to try and capture Cargolux from a different perspective. Specifically, right next to the apron that it now parks on. This apron, known as Apron IX, is slated to become YYC's new main cargo apron. In the long term, I believe Cathay Pacific will be moving their operations here as well. But in the short term, you can enjoy this video of LX-VCA landing, taxiing, and unloading at Calgary International Airport, with full ATC ;) Apologies about the fence. Next time I'll stand in a better location.\n\nThanks for watching!

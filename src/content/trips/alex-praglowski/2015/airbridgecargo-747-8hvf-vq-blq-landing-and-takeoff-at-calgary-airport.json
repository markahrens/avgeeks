 "name": "AirBridgeCargo 747-8HVF [VQ-BLQ] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "This was a nice surprise for YYC spotters! Here we have AirBridge Cargo Airlines' (a member of the Volga-Dnepr Group) first 747-8 freighter landing at Calgary International Airport on runway 17L, taxiing, parked, and taking off on 17R the next day. This is certainly one of the more unexpected visitors to Calgary Airport, but I'm glad I was able to catch both arrival and departure! ATC is included throughout, with an interesting conversation during the approach. Enjoy my very first shot of Russia's very first 747-8F!\n\nThanks for watching!

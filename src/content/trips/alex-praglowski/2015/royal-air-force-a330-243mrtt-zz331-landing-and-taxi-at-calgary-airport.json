 "name": "Royal Air Force A330-243MRTT [ZZ331] Landing and Taxi at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Finally managed to catch one of the RAF A330MRTTs! Here we have ZZ331 making a fairly windy landing at Calgary International Airport. This summer's RAF flights have begun, and we've been seeing a lot of these military A330s lately; however, they're pretty hard to track. Some condensation can be seen around 1:00, and sorry for the shaky footage on taxi. It was fairly windy and I stood on a picnic table, so I wasn't able to set up my tripod. ATC included with captions. Regardless, I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

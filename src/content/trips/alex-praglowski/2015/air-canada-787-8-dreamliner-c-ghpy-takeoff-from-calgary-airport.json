 "description": "How convenient, a 787 comes to Calgary shortly after I post my story about the 787's first visit and the resulting adventure ;) On that note, I have to say an enormous thank you to all of you for the supportive comments and future wishes. Seriously, you people are awesome :)\n\nAnyway, here we have AC's sixth 787-8, built in Charleston, North Carolina, and delivered in November 2014, departing YYC as AC1150 to YYZ, operating as an equipment change. Nice surprise for the passengers, and for us spotters as well! Enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!

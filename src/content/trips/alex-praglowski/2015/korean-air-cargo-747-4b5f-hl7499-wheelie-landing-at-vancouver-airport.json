 "name": "Korean Air Cargo 747-4B5F [HL7499] Wheelie Landing at Vancouver Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "One of my favorite catches from my YVR spotting trip! I had no idea Korean Air Cargo even flew to Vancouver. Here we have one of YVR's regularly scheduled cargo flights, KE9278, arriving from Guadalajara International Airport making a stop before departing onwards to Seoul Incheon. Listen to those PW4056 engines, interesting how the pilots pulled the power back after touching down. ATC is included, with captions for the landing clearance. Enjoy the video!\n\nI'd also like to thank all of my viewers for 1,300 subscribers and 300,000 video views :) I honestly never thought I'd make it this far!\n\nThanks for watching!

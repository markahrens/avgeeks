 "name": "British Airways 787-8 Dreamliner [G-ZBJG]  Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Here's a quick video from me today, a British Airways 787-8 landing at Calgary International Airport, arriving from LHR. Sadly BA has switched back to the 767 for the summer season, and the Dreamliner is slated to return in October, provided BA lasts long enough at YYC. I had just finished getting a few spool ups (for the video last year), and saw this bird on short final just as I was walking away. I then got up onto the picnic table and shot this clip with my tripod, with a pretty nice view over the fence! Enjoy, and sorry for the lack of activity lately.\n\nThanks for watching!

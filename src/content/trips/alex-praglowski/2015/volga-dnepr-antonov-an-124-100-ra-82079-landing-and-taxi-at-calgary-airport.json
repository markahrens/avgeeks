 "description": "Now on Flickr! https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\nIt's about time! YYC hasn't had an Antonov 124 in almost a year. This 20 year old example, RA-82079, was one of the few to visit in summer 2014, and is seen here touching down on runway 17L and taxiing close up. I also tried out a new location, which worked out very well for the unexpected runway change that occurred a few minutes before arrival. Sorry for any shakiness, I may have had too much coffee that morning ;) Enjoy this Ukrainian bird with ATC!\n\nThanks for watching!

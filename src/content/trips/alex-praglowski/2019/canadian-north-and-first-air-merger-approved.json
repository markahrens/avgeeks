 "name": "Canadian North and First Air Merger APPROVED",
 "description": "On Wednesday June 19th, the federal government approved the merger of Canadian North and First Air, two northern airlines serving the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.\n\nThe merger itself was actually announced last year, but the two airlines have been waiting for regulatory approval since then.\n\nIn today's video, I talk about the merger and the circumstances surrounding it, including a report from Canada's Competition Bureau and the airlines' lengthy response to it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this merger?

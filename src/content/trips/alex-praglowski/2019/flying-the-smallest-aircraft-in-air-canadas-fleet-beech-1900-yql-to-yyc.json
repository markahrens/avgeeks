 "name": "Flying the SMALLEST Aircraft in Air Canada's Fleet! Beech 1900 YQL to YYC",
 "description": "I've always wanted to see what it was like to fly the smallest member of Air Canada's fleet, the Beechcraft 1900D! \n\nIn early April, I did just that, and seeing as Air Georgian recently stopped operating theirs for Air Canada, I thought that now was a good time to share my experience on this unique aircraft.\n\nSeveral B1900Ds still operate for Air Canada Express in the Maritimes, but by EVAS Air instead, so the aircraft is still flying for Air Canada, just not by Air Georgian in the west.\n\nHope you enjoy this look at what it's like to fly on Air Canada Express' tiny 18-seater!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPraglowski\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada Express (Air Georgian) (GGN/ZX)\nAircraft: Beechcraft 1900D (B190)\nFlight Number: ZX7218\nSeat: 2A\nLivery: Air Canada Old (2005-2017), no titles\nEngines: 2x PW PT6A-67D\nRegistration: C-GHGA\nRoute: Lethbridge (YQL) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: GEORGIAN 7218\nRunway used: 23 (YQL) - 29 (YYC)\nDate filmed: April 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",

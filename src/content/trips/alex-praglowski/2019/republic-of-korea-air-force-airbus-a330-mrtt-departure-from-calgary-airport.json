 "description": "A rare visitor! This aircraft stopped in Calgary as a fuel stop on delivery from Spain to South Korea, a bit of a surprise as these aircraft were apparently supposed to fly through Vancouver. Not complaining!\n\nThis is the second Airbus A330 MRTT (Multi-Role Tanker/Transport) for the Republic of Korea Air Force, departing for Gimhae Air Base in South Korea this morning! Enjoy this brand new military A330 departing Calgary, a bit different from our usual ones from the Royal Air Force.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nOperator: Airbus Defence\nAircraft: Airbus A330-243MRTT (A332)\nFlight Number: AED351\nLivery: ROKAF Gray\nEngines: 2x RR Trent 700\nRegistration: ROKAF 19-001\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Gimhae Air Base (BUS)\nCallsign: Alpha Echo Delta 351 heavy\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: March 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",

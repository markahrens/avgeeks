 "name": "WestJet Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner First Departure from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "After arriving in some nasty weather yesterday, WestJet's first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner departed their home base here at Calgary International Airport for Toronto-Pearson, where they'll complete their post-delivery checks, as the new widebody hangar in Calgary isn't yet complete. It'll be done in March in time for the new transatlantic flights out of Calgary with the Dreamliner!\n\nSeen here is Tail 901, \"Clive Beddoe\", under tow out of WestJet's apron, and then making a smoky dual-engine startup on taxiway Foxtrot, taxiing up close on its way to be de-iced, and then making a very light departure off runway 17R. ATC is included throughout, enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner\nFlight Number: WS8969\nLivery: New (2018)\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B\nRegistration: C-GUDH\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Toronto-Pearson (YYZ)\nCallsign: WESTJET 8969 heavy\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: January 18, 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

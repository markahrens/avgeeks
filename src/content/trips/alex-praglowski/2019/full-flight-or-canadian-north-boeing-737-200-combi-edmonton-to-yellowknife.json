 "description": "In June 2018, I flew with Canadian North Airlines from Edmonton, Alberta, to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories and back on their classic Boeing 737-200 Combi! Since then, I'd uploaded trip reports on each of the flights.\n\nAfter uploading my \"Why Do Boeing 737-200s Still Fly in Canada?\" video, I got a LOT of requests on the trip reports for a complete takeoff and landing video, without trimming things as I often have to do in the trip reports to keep the length manageable.\n\nWell, say no more, here is 35 minutes of pure Boeing 737-200 wing view - No music, no comments, just a flight back in time heading above the 60th parallel.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n00:00 - Announcements\n02:58 - Under tow for engine start\n05:30 - Engine start\n07:20 - Taxi Begins\n09:20 - Takeoff\n19:05 - Cruise\n20:55 - Descent\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nTRIP REPORT ON THIS FLIGHT:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3-kWnIqHc0\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Canadian North (MPE/5T)\nAircraft: B737-275 Combi (B73M)\nFlight Number: 5T438\nSeat: 15A\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17\nRegistration: C-GOPW\nRoute: Edmonton International (YEG) - Yellowknife (YZF)\nCallsign: EMPRESS 438\nRunway used: 12 (YEG) - 34 (YZF)\nDate filmed: June 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

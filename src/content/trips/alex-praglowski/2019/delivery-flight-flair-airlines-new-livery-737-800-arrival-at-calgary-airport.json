 "description": "A big day for Flair Airlines today, as they took delivery of their first company-owned Boeing 737-800 Next Generation aircraft, in their new 2019 livery.\n\nCalgary was fortunate enough to be the first Canadian city to get this bird, registered as C-FFLA, and was delivered here from Woensdrecht Air Base in the Netherlands via Keflavik.\n\nFlair is headquartered in Edmonton, but, I believe, has leased hangar space in Calgary for maintenance.\n\nThis aircraft was a former Primera Air 737-800, and should be the first of several to be delivered as Flair phases out the 737-400s. From what I hear, the aircraft will spend a few days in Calgary getting post-delivery checks done before entering service.\n\nEnjoy this video of the first aircraft in Flair's... unique new livery!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Flair Airlines (FLE/F8)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-800 (B738)\nFlight Number: F8913\nLivery: New (2019)\nEngines: 2x CFM56\nRegistration: C-FFLA\nRoute: Reykjavik-Keflavik (KEF) - Calgary (YYC) \nCallsign: FLAIR 913\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: March 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",

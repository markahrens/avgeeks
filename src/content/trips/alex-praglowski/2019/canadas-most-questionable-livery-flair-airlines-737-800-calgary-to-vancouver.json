 "name": "Canada's Most QUESTIONABLE Livery? Flair Airlines 737-800 Calgary to Vancouver",
 "description": "Flair Airlines is a Canadian low-cost carrier that started up in 2005 as a charter airline. They began scheduled flights as “Canada’s Low Fare Airline” in 2017, with a fleet of 7 Boeing 737-400s.\n\nLong story short, they rebranded again in February, opting for a more minimalistic look across the board, as well as this interesting new livery for their new 737-800s.

 "name": "Hainan Airlines Old Livery Airbus A330-300 Arriving at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "With the debut of the 787 into its fleet, Hainan Airlines introduced a new livery, with a red stripe waving from the tail down the majority of the fuselage. But there are a few aircraft still in this older livery, including this Airbus A330-300 seen here, B-5905. Hainan normally serves Calgary with their A330-200s, so having the -300 itself is a bit special. Enjoy this close up view of this Chinese A330-300!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Hainan Airlines (CHH/HU)\nAircraft: Airbus A330-343 (A333)\nFlight Number: HU7977\nLivery: Old\nEngines: 2x RR Trent 772B-60\nRegistration: B-5905\nRoute: Beijing (PEK) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: HAINAN 7977 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: December 25, 2018\nLocal time: 1500\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

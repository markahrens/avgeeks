 "name": "WestJet's IMPRESSIVE Premium Offering - 737-600 Calgary to Abbotsford",
 "description": "On their 737 family, WestJet has a small Premium cabin up front, with three rows of 2x2 seating, formerly known as WestJet “Plus”.\n\nAnyone booking a Premium or Business Class fare with WestJet to Europe on a connecting itinerary, also receives a seat in Premium on board the shorter flight. While Premium on the Q400s and Saab 340s isn’t all that different from regular economy, the 737s are a different story!\n\nHaving flown their Dreamliner in Business long haul, I booked Premium on this one hour flight from Calgary to Abbotsford to see what they have to offer up front on a domestic 737 flight.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-6CT (B736)\nFlight Number: WS637\nSeat: 1F\nLivery: Old\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-7B22 \nRegistration: C-GXWJ\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Abbotsford (YXX)\nCallsign: WESTJET 637\nRunway used: 35L (YYC) - 07 (YXX)\nDate filmed: August 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n#TallPeopleFlying\n\nOutro song by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcrp8_5nooSYwSL1dpX3DA\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",

 "name": "Delta Air Lines FIRST CLASS Review! Airbus A320 Salt Lake City to San Diego",
 "description": "In November 2018, I flew with Delta Air Lines in their First Class from Calgary to San Diego. This is the third and final leg of this unnecessarily convoluted routing, from Salt Lake City, Utah, to San Diego, California, on board Delta's Airbus A320!\n\nI realize this video's fairly old as far as trip reports go, and since it's pretty clear that you all like to see Canadian content a bit more, I'd put off making it until now. Delta hasn't really changed their Domestic First product since then, so I think this experience still holds up today.\n\nSpecial thank you to Sean Currie for letting me borrow his GoPro for this trip. (I hadn't bought my Hero 7 yet, that's how long ago this was, lol)\n\nHope y'all enjoy :)\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Delta Air Lines (DAL/DL)\nAircraft: Airbus A320-212\nFlight Number: DL2960\nSeat: 3A\nLivery: New\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-5A3 \nRegistration: N343NW\nRoute: Salt Lake City (SLC) - San Diego (SAN)\nCallsign: DELTA 2960\nRunway used: 34R (SLC) - 27 (SAN)\nDate filmed: November 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",

 "description": "Is this the world's best looking 737-200? I certainly think so!\n\nChrono Aviation is a Canadian charter airline based in Quebec. Founded in 2012, they have a diverse fleet of thirteen aircraft, including Pilatus PC-12s, Beechcraft 1900s, Dash 8s, and most recently, Boeing 737-200s.\n\nChrono currently has a fleet of 5 737-200s, with two flying and three being used for spares, and plans to acquire two more aircraft by the end of 2019.\n\nLike every other 737-200 in Canada, Chrono’s aircraft are equipped with gravel kits. As this is a combi aircraft, the configuration varies depending on a customer’s needs, but the aircraft can carry up to 120 passengers, in brand new 737NG seats!\n\nOn April 1st, Chrono celebrated their inaugural flight for the Baffinland mine, flying from Montreal Saint-Hubert (YHU) to Mary River (YMV) with a stop in Iqaluit (YFB), and I was invited to take in the festivities!\n\nA huge thank you to everyone at Chrono for letting me be a part of it, and I hope you enjoy this airside departure footage.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Chrono Aviation (Chrono Jet)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-200 Combi (B732)\nFlight Number: MBK790\nLivery: Chrono Aviation Matte Black\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney JT8D-15A \nRegistration: C-GTVO \nRoute: Montreal-Saint Hubert (YHU) - Iqaluit (YFB) - Mary River (YMV)\nCallsign: MADBLACK 790 (\"MADBLACK sept neuf zero\")\nRunway used: 24R (deux quatre droite)\nDate filmed: April 1, 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",

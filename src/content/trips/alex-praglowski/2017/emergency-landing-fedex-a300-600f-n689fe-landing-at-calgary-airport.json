 "name": "EMERGENCY LANDING! FedEx A300-600F [N689FE] Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "On April 29th, 2017, at approximately 8:30AM, FedEx flight 140 from Memphis to Calgary suffered what appeared to be a complete loss of their green hydraulic system, which meant that they had no nose gear steering, had to manually drop the gear before arrival, and be towed to their apron. After arrival, the green hydraulics strangely appeared to be back. I was lucky enough to be out spotting already that morning, and the sight of three fire trucks showing up on one of the runway entrances was certainly a clue that something was going on. Thankfully, the aircraft landed safely, and was towed off the runway after about 20 minutes. As one of the pilots said, \"this'll be interesting for maintenance\"! ATC is included.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: FedEx (FDX/FX)\nAircraft: Airbus A300F4-605R (A306)\nAircraft Name: Christoff\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2A5F\nRegistration: N689FE\nRoute: MEM-YYC\nCallsign: FedEx 140 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: April 29, 2017\nLocal time: 0830\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N689FE\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2017\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

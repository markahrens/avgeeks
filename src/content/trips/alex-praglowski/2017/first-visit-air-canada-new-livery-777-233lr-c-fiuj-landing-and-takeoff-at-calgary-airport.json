 "name": "First Visit! Air Canada New Livery 777-233LR [C-FIUJ] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "As part of what is known as the busiest travel day of the year, Air Canada sent a 777-200LR on the regular Toronto-Calgary-Toronto route, along with a myriad of other heavies, a route that's one of the busiest domestic routes out of Calgary but is normally served with narrowbody aircraft. Much to the luck of YYC spotters, the aircraft operating the flight happened to be one of the three 777s that Air Canada has painted in their new livery revealed earlier this year! Here we have the first visit of a 777 in Air Canada's new livery at YYC Calgary International Airport, landing on 35R and then departing again a few hours later. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-200LR (B77L)\nAircraft Name: 703\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x GE90-110B1L\nRegistration: C-FIUJ\nRoute: Toronto-Pearson (YYZ) - Calgary (YYC) - Toronto-Pearson (YYZ)\nCallsign: Air Canada 141/148 heavy \nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: December 22, 2017\nLocal time: 1300, 1500\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFIUJ\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

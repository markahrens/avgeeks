 "name": "Air Canada New Livery A330-343 [C-GFAF] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "After catching Air Canada's new livery on the 77L, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the sole A330 in the new livery was heading my way! Here we have C-GFAF, otherwise known as fin 931, landing runway 35R, taxiing up close on Delta 4, and then departing again off of 35L. This bird also happens to be the one and only Air Canada A330 that I've flown on (so far), from Toronto to Munich in summer 2016! Air Canada's A330s are a rare visitor at YYC these days, with nearly all of their flights being based out of Montreal and Toronto, but thanks to the Christmas rush, a couple flights from YYZ have been upgraded to the 330 for a few days. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Airbus A330-300 (A333)\nAircraft Name: 931\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x RR Trent 772B-60\nRegistration: C-GFAF\nRoute: Toronto-Pearson (YYZ) - Calgary (YYC) - Toronto-Pearson (YYZ)\nCallsign: Air Canada 143/150 heavy \nRunway used: 35R/35L\nDate filmed: December 27, 2017\nLocal time: 1430/1700\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGFAF\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

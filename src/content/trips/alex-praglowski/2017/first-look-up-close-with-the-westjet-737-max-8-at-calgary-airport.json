 "description": "Huge thanks to a WestJet employee for allowing me to attend this event! Today, October 11th, WestJet held an event for employees and media with their Boeing 737 MAX 8. They currently have two 737 MAXes, C-FRAX (which I caught on its delivery flight) and C-FNAX which came in a few days after. FNAX was open to employees and media to look around it, while FRAX was being prepared for a special employee flight over the Rockies (which I also caught, video tomorrow). Enjoy this quick tour of WestJet's 737 MAX 8 (which still has that new airplane smell)!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2017\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

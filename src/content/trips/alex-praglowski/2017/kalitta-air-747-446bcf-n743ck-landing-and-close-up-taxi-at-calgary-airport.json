 "name": "Kalitta Air 747-446BCF [N743CK] Landing and Close Up Taxi at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "What a smooth landing! Every summer, several equestrian events are held in Spruce Meadows, a venue south of Calgary famous for its show jumping horse events. Show jumping horses are brought in from all around the world for these events, and this particular flight was bringing some of the horses for the \"Masters\" tournament from Europe. This particular flight is an annual visitor that YYC spotters welcome each year, a 747 from Liege carrying dozens of professional show jumping horses. The past couple of years, National Air Cargo has flown the horses in, although Israeli carrier CAL Cargo Airlines flew them in last year. This year was, obviously, different as well, with this Kalitta Air 747 in a partial DHL livery!

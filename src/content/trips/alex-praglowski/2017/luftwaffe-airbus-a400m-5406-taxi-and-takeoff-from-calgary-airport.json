 "description": "YYC has briefly turned into an Air Force Base! Yesterday, July 6th, we received three surprise military visitors from Germany, Spain, and France, bringing troops and equipment for NATO training at CFB Suffield, a Canadian Forces Base southeast of Calgary. This occurs every year, with it comes some interesting military visitors! I'm usually not able to see them all, but fortunately, I was able to see at least one special visitor in the air, in the form of this Luftwaffe A400M departing (presumably) back to Germany. ATC is included, hope you enjoy my first video of an A400M departing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: German Air Force/Luftwaffe (GAF)\nAircraft: Airbus A400M (A4M)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Military grey with \"Luftwaffe\" titles\nEngines: 4x Europrop TP400-D6 \nRegistration: 54+06\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Washington Dulles (IAD)\nCallsign: German Air Force 123 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: July 7, 2017\nLocal time: 0900\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "description": "Air Canada's 787 with the new livery has only been to YYC twice since it's unveiling. We won't have another chance to see it until June when our daily flight to Tokyo is changed to a 788 for the peak summer season (this flight has since been changed to a 789). Here's the second visit of the new livery on the Dreamliner departing off to LHR a couple weeks ago. ATC is included, enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-8 (B788)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New (2017-)\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B \nRegistration: C-GHPQ\nRoute: YYC-LHR\nCallsign: Air Canada 850 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: March 24, 2017\nLocal time: 2000\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGHPQ\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2017\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",

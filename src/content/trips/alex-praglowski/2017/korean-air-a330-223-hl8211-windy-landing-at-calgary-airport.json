 "description": "Every summer since 2015, Korean Air has operated 3 charter flights to Calgary from Seoul-Incheon with their Airbus A330-200. Even though Calgary now has a second connection to Asia through Hainan, it's always nice to see Korean Air here, even just on an annual basis. Here is our third and final flight of the year from Korean, operated by HL8211 from Seoul-Incheon this afternoon in some windy conditions! ATC is included,  hope you all enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Korean Air (KAL/KE)\nAircraft: Airbus A330-200 (A332)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney PW4170 \nRegistration: HL8211\nRoute: Seoul-Incheon (ICN) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Korean Air 9075 heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: August 12, 2017\nLocal time: 1300\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/HL8211\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

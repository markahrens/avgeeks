 "name": "Olympia Aviation (Detroit Red Wings) MD-81 [N682RW] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Olympia Aviation has been operating this McDonnell Douglas MD-81 for the Detroit Red Wings for several years now, and this is the first time I've managed to catch it. Aside from being a member of the MD-80 family, an already unique family of aircraft in this day and age, it is only one of 6 MD-81s still flying in the world, and the only one in North America. This 36-year old bird certainly looks and sounds fantastic, and I'm very glad I had the opportunity to do so! Enjoy this special video, featuring some close ups of the aircraft, a brief view of the loading, engine start up, taxi, and takeoff en route to Edmonton, with ATC included!\n\nAlso, for my more hockey-centric followers, they were in town to play the Calgary Flames, and lost 3-2. \n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Olympia Aviation\nAircraft: McDonnell Douglas MD-81 (M81)\nAircraft Name: None\nEngines: 2x PW JT8D-217\nRegistration: N682RW \nRoute: YYC-YEG\nCallsign: November 682 Romeo Whiskey\nRunway used: 35L\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "name": "U.S. Navy Boeing E-6B Mercury [164410] Landing at Lethbridge Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Like my C-5M video, this also has to be one of my best catches of the year. The only difference is, I had no clue this was even coming. The Lethbridge Airshow's website never had a Boeing E-6B Mercury confirmed, or even shown as requested. Needless to say, I was shocked when I heard \"Shadow 55\" call in and then saw a 707 banking on downwind. I'm very happy to have caught this rare aircraft, which is the last and most recently built variant of the venerable Boeing 707. The United States has a fleet of 16 of these birds, which are used as airborne command posts and communications relays. This video also completes my Boeing 7-series collection, having filmed the 717 through 787 (with the exception of certain variants), so I am profoundly glad that I was there. Enjoy this special catch, with ATC!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nAlso, in case you haven't heard, my good friend and fellow videographer CathayA340 has started uploading again!

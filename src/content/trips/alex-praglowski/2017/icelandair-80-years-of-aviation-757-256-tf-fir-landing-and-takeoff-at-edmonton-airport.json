 "name": "Icelandair \"80 Years of Aviation\" 757-256 [TF-FIR] Landing and Takeoff at Edmonton Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Just three weeks ago, Icelandair unveiled a new special livery celebrating their 80th anniversary on TF-FIR, one of their many 757s. The Vatnajökull glacier, the largest glacier in Europe, is featured prominently along the aircraft, which was revealed in Norwich, England on May 3rd. \"Vatnajökull\" has been to Edmonton once before, but last weekend I was fortunate enough to be there the day it flew in, and what a fantastic livery it is. Icelandair nailed it! Still have to see Hekla Aurora though, but I'm very glad to have filmed this amazing aircraft just a three hour drive from YYC. This video includes the arrival and departure of \"Vatnajökull\" on May 20th, 2017, with ATC included. Enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Icelandair (ICE/FI)\nAircraft: Boeing 757-200 (B752)\nAircraft Name: \"Vatnajökull\"\nLivery: \"80 Years of Aviation\"\nEngines: 2x RR RB211-535E4 \nRegistration: TF-FIR\nRoute: KEF-YEG-KEF\nCallsign: Ice Air 693/692 heavy\nRunway used: 30\nDate filmed: May 20, 2017\nLocal time: 1730, 1830\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/TFFIR\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

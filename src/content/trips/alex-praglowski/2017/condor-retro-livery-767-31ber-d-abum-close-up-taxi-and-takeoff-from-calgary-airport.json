 "description": "On August 3rd, Condor flight 2453 from Vancouver to Frankfurt diverted to Calgary due to a medical emergency on board. The aircraft operating the flight was none other than Condor's retro livery 767, a livery that I hadn't actually seen before the diversion. Here's the flight taxiing up close on Bravo and departing 17L 2 hours after its initial arrival here. ATC is included, hope you enjoy this classic looking 767!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Condor Flugdienst (CFG/DE)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-300ER (B763)\nAircraft Name: \"Achim\"\nLivery: Retro (1980s)\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B6F \nRegistration: D-ABUM\nRoute: Vancouver (YVR) - Calgary (YYC) - Frankfurt-Main (FRA)\nCallsign: Condor 2453 heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: August 3, 2017\nLocal time: 1950\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/DABUM\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "description": "Hainan Airlines typically serves Calgary with their Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner three times a week. This past Saturday was an exception however, when they sent one of their 787-9s for the first time since the route started almost a year ago now. Hopefully more equipment swaps like this happen in the future, and especially with one of Hainan's Kung Fu Panda 789s! ATC is included, hope you enjoy this special arrival video.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Hainan Airlines (HNA/HU)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (B789)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B\nRegistration: B-7880\nRoute: PEK-YYC\nCallsign: Hainan 7977 heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: April 29, 2017\nLocal time: 1330\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/B7880\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

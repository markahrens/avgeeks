 "name": "Boeing 747-4H6LCF \"Dreamlifter\" [N718BA] Wet Arrival at Paine Field ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "One of the more common, but always impressive visitors to Paine Field is Boeing's 4-strong fleet of 747-400LCF (Large Cargo Freighter) aircraft, which ship 787 Dreamliner parts around the globe for manufacture in Everett and Charleston, where 787s are put together. Here we have N718BA, a former Malaysia Airlines aircraft, landing on runway 16R and taxiing into the Dreamlifter unloading facility, taken from the fantastic viewing deck at Boeing's Future of Flight facility.

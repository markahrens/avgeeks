 "name": "First Visit! Edelweiss Air A340-313X [HB-JMG] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Last year, Edelweiss Air restarted seasonal flights from Zurich to Calgary, twice a week, with a mix of A330-200s and A330-300s. Recently, they acquired some A340s from their parent airline, Swiss, for expansion. Thankfully, YYC is one of their A340 destinations this year, becoming the first scheduled A340 operator in YYC since Lufthansa ended service here in 2012. The A340-300 looks absolutely fantastic in the Edelweiss livery, and I can't wait to catch it more! For now, here's the first flight of the season arriving and departing YYC this afternoon, with ATC included.

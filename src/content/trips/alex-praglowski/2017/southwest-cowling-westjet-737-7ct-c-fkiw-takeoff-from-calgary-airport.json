 "name": "Southwest Cowling! WestJet 737-7CT [C-FKIW] Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "I'm not entirely sure when, but at some point in the last two weeks, clearly this WestJet 737-700 needed an engine cowling while somewhere in the US, and I guess Southwest had one handy. This bird has been flying around with it for over a week now, and surprisingly, it hasn't been changed back. Enjoy this quick video of what some spotters have dubbed \"SouthWestJet\"! ATC included.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: WestJet (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-700 (B73G)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-7B24 \nRegistration: C-FKIW\nRoute: YYC-YVR\nCallsign: WestJet 115\nRunway used: 35L\nLocal Time: 1510\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFKIW\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

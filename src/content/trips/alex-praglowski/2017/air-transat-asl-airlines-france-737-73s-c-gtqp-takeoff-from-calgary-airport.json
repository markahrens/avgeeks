 "name": "Air Transat (ASL Airlines France) 737-73S [C-GTQP] Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "In recent years, Air Transat has leased 737s from European airlines during the winter season for some extra capacity. Normally, the 737-700s skip YYC altogether, operating out of YUL, YYZ, and YVR, but this was a nice surprise! Here we have C-GTQP, leased from ASL Airlines France, taxiing and taking off runway 35L for SJD (Los Cabos). ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Transat (TSC/TS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-700 (B73G)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: ASL Airlines France\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-7B20 \nRegistration: C-GTQP\nRoute: YYC-SJD\nCallsign: Transat 450\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: April 15, 2017\nLocal time: 1230\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGTQP\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

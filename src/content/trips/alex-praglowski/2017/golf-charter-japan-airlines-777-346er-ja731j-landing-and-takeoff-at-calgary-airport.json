 "name": "Golf Charter - Japan Airlines 777-346ER [JA731J] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "What a perfect way to end the summer! This very special Japan Airlines charter came in today to bring the PGA Tour Champions Players from the Shaw Charity Classic held in Calgary to the next event, the Japan Airlines Championship, held in Narita, Japan. Given the location of the next tournament, and the sponsor, it seems reasonable that Japan Airlines would send an aircraft for just that purpose, and what an awesome visitor! Here we have JA731J, wearing a special \"PGA Tour Champions\" livery, arriving at Calgary International Airport on 35R as an empty ferry in, and departing later that day with a full flight of golfers out to Tokyo-Narita. ATC is included, I hope you enjoy this fantastic rare visitor!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Japan Airlines (JAL/JL)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-300ER (B77W)\nAircraft Name: \nLivery: \"PGA Tour Champions\"\nEngines: 2x GE90-115B\nRegistration: JA731J\nRoute: Tokyo-Narita (NRT) - Calgary (YYC) - Tokyo-Narita (NRT)\nCallsign: Japan Air 8912/8805 heavy\nRunway used: 35R, 35R\nDate filmed: September 3, 2017\nLocal time: 1430, 1930\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/JA731J\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "description": "What a fantastic looking aircraft! I've never been quite lucky enough to film Gulfstream's flagship aircraft, the G650ER in action, but I happened to be out spotting already when this fairly new G650 arrived, after a round trip two hour flight around Alberta. Not quite sure what it was doing or why it was here, but I'm glad to have filmed it! Gonna have to look out for these more often, Gulfstream makes some fantastic looking bizjets. ATC is included, enjoy my first catch of a G650ER!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Private\nAircraft: Gulfstream G650ER (GLF6)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: White with red and black cheatline\nEngines: 2x Rolls-Royce BR725 A1-12\nRegistration: N650VC\nRoute: YYC-YYC\nCallsign: November 650 Victor Charlie\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: June 3, 2017\nLocal time: 1200\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

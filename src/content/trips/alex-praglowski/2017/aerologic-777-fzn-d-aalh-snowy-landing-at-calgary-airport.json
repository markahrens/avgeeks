 "description": "My first time seeing AeroLogic! And, to my knowledge, this is the first visit of an AeroLogic aircraft in Calgary. This bird was operating a special charter into YYC, carrying a load of Porsches, much like that Lufthansa MD-11F I caught back in December! Despite the fact that it was minus 25, I'm glad that I caught this beauty! ATC is included, enjoy this very white aircraft in a very white setting. \n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: AeroLogic (3S/BOX)\nAircraft: Boeing 777 Freighter (B77F)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE90-110B1L\nRegistration: D-AALH\nRoute: FRA-YYC\nCallsign: German Cargo 410 heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nLocal Time: 1630\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAALH\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

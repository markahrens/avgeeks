 "description": "FedEx's fleet of Airbus A310s is slowly dwindling, but while newer A310s are being retired, the first A310-300 ever built is still going strong flying packages all over North America! N803FD first flew in July 1985 with the registration F-WWCA as the testbed and prototype for the A310-300 series. It flew for Air Niugini for over a decade, and was then converted and delivered to FedEx in 2005. Hope to get more videos of this classic bird, the sound and smoke on departure is just fantastic! ATC is included, hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: FedEx (FDX/FX)\nAircraft: Airbus A310-300 (A313)\nAircraft Name: Rylan\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x PW PW4152 \nRegistration: N803FD\nRoute: YYC-MEM\nCallsign: FedEx 141 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: March 27, 2017\nLocal time: 1930\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N803FD\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

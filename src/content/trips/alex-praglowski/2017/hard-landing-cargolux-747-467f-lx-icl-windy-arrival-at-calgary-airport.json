 "name": "HARD LANDING! Cargolux 747-467F [LX-ICL] Windy Arrival at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Thanks to a powerful low pressure system from the west, we had some crazy winds in Calgary today! This led to some very interesting arrivals with huge wind gusts, causing quite a few go-arounds. One of the more special arrivals was this Cargolux 747-400 in a basic Cathay Pacific livery which made a very hard and early touchdown on 35L in some perfect lighting between clouds. If you've seen some of my other videos from this spot, you'll see that aircraft touchdown much further, just before the ILS mast comes into view. In this case, they touched down right on the runway numbers! Hope you enjoy this spectacular windy landing, with ATC included.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Cargolux Airlines International (CLX/CV)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-400F (B744)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Basic Cathay Pacific Cargo w/ Cargolux titles\nEngines: 4x RR RB211-524G/H-T \nRegistration: LX-ICL\nRoute: Luxembourg (LUX) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Cargolux 772 heavy\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: October 17, 2017\nLocal time: 1800\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/LXICL\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

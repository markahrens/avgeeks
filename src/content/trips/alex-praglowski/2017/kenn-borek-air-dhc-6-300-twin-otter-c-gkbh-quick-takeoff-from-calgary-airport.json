 "name": "Kenn Borek Air DHC-6-300 Twin Otter [C-GKBH] QUICK Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Kenn Borek Air is one of the more unique airlines in North America. With their 20-strong fleet of Twin Otters, they fly into some of the most inhospitable areas on our planet, including a rescue mission to Antarctica in the dead of winter. Pretty sure this particular bird has been there at least once. Anyway, here's C-GKBH taxiing by on Bravo and taking off runway 17L from Zulu, while holding the brakes and making an extremely quick departure. ATC is included, enjoy! \n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Kenn Borek Air (KBA/4K)\nAircraft: De Havilland Twin Otter (DH6)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-27\nRegistration: C-GKBH\nRoute: YYC-???\nCallsign: Borek 306\nRunway used: 17L\nLocal Time: 1500\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

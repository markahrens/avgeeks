 "name": "KLM 777-306ER [PH-BVN] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Another clip from back in the summer! Here we have KLM's largest twinjet taxiing up close and departing 17L from Zulu, one of the intersections that's normally used by regional aircraft, located about 4,000 feet down the runway. Granted, that still leaves 10,000 for this big bird, which is still more than enough, but it's not often that you see a 777-300ER take an intersection for departure here in Calgary! Enjoy this close up footage with ATC.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM/KL)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-300ER (B77W)\nAircraft Name: \"Tijuca National Park\"\nLivery: Revised (2015)\nEngines: 2x GE90-115B\nRegistration: PH-BVN\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Amsterdam-Schiphol (AMS)\nCallsign: KLM 678 heavy\nRunway used: 17L shortened\nDate filmed: September 1, 2017\nLocal time: 1530\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/PHBVN\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

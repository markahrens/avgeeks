 "name": "Heavy Crosswind Landings and Takeoffs on Runway 29 at Calgary International Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "With all the crosswind action that we had in October, I knew I had to make the most of it with a compilation of some of our heavies on Calgary's crosswind runway! Here we have a couple of Calgary's regular heavy arrivals and departures using our 8,000 foot crosswind runway which offers a lot more unique viewpoints than the parallels do. ATC is included for all aircraft, hope you enjoy these 10+ minutes of crosswind action!\n\nI also met a fantastic aviation videographer that day, uniteddeltafan!

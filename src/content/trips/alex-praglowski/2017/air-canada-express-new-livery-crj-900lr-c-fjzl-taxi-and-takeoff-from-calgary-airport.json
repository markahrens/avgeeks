 "description": "The latest aircraft type in Air Canada's fleet to receive their new livery is the CRJ-900LR! The second one to be painted as such is seen here taxiing up close on Bravo (with a very friendly crew) and taking off 17L en route to Houston on what I believe is the third or fourth visit of the new Air Canada Express livery. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada Express operated by Jazz Air (JZA/QK)\nAircraft: Bombardier CRJ-900LR (CR9)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x GE CF34-8C5 \nRegistration: C-FJZL \nRoute: YYC-IAH\nCallsign: Jazz 106\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: May 5, 2017\nLocal time: 1900\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFJZL\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

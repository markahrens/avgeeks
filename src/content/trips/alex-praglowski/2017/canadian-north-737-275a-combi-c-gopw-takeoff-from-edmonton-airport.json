 "name": "Canadian North 737-275(A) Combi [C-GOPW] Takeoff from Edmonton Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Canadian North is an airline based in Northern Canada, operating primarily 737s on milk runs from Yellowknife and Iqaluit to a number of northern towns. Their fleet consists mostly of 737-300s now, but they still operate two classic 737-200s equipped with gravel kits for flights into unpaved airports. This particular one is 37 years old, and first flew with Pacific Western Airlines, was then transferred to Canadian Airlines after the two merged, and then to Air Canada when it and Canadian merged. It now flies with Canadian North, Canadian Airlines' former northern division, hence the \"Empress\" callsign, which was Canadian's former callsign. Anyway, enjoy this classic 737 departing Edmonton for Yellowknife, with ATC.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Canadian North (MPE/5T)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-200 Combi (Advanced) (B732)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17\nRegistration: C-GOPW\nRoute: Edmonton (YEG) - Yellowknife (YZF)\nCallsign: Empress 438\nRunway used: 12\nDate filmed: May 22, 2017\nLocal time: 0800\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGOPW\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

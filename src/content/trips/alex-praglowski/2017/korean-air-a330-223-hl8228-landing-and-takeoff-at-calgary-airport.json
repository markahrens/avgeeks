 "description": "Every summer since 2015, Korean Air has operated 3 charter flights to Calgary from Seoul-Incheon with their Airbus A330-200. Even though Calgary now has a second connection to Asia through Hainan, it's always nice to see Korean Air here, even just on an annual basis. Anyway, here is HL8228 arriving on runway 35L this afternoon and then departing 3 hours later, also on runway 35L.

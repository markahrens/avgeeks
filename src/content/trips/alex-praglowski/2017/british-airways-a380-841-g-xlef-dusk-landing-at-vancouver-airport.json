 "description": "I was very glad to be able to see British Airways' A380 at YVR not once, but twice during my last trip to YVR in May 2016. Here we have G-XLEF making a slightly windy arrival on runway 26R as \"Speedbird Five Victor Yankee Super\". I've still got a couple more clips coming up from YVR, so stay tuned for those. Can't wait to go back sometime! Hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: British Airways (BAW/BA)\nAircraft: Airbus A380-800 (A388)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x RR Trent 900\nRegistration: G-XLEF\nRoute: LHR-YVR\nCallsign: Speedbird 5 Victor Yankee Super\nRunway used: 26R\nLocal Time: 1900\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/GXLEA\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "description": "As part of its 30 year anniversary, Air Transat painted 3 of their 4 A330-300s in this unique light blue livery! One actually came to Calgary in the spring to cover for some cancelled flights to Mexico but I wasn't able to make it. Fortunately I caught it here in Montreal, departing for Toronto, taxiing up close and departing 24L! Enjoy this special Air Transat.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Transat (TSC/TS)\nAircraft: Airbus A330-300 (A333)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: \"30 years\"\nEngines: 2x RR Trent 772-60 \nRegistration: C-GKTS\nRoute: Montréal-Trudeau (YUL) - Toronto-Pearson (YYZ)\nCallsign: Transat 468 heavy/lourd\nRunway used: 24L\nDate filmed: July 18, 2017\nLocal time: 1745\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGKTS\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

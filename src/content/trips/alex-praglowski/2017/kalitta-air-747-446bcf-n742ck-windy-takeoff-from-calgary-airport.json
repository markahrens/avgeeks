 "name": "Kalitta Air 747-446(BCF) [N742CK] Windy Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Every summer, several equestrian events are held in Spruce Meadows, a venue south of Calgary famous for its show jumping horse events. Show jumping horses are brought in from all around the world for these events, and this particular flight was bringing some of the horses for the \"Masters\" tournament from Europe. This particular flight is an annual visitor that YYC spotters welcome each year, a 747 from Liege carrying dozens of professional show jumping horses. The past couple of years, National Air Cargo has flown the horses in, although Israeli carrier CAL Cargo Airlines flew them in last year. This year, Kalitta Air flew both the inbound and the outbound flights, and here's the latter, flown by N742CK (if only it were actually true to its registration) out of a very windy Calgary for Liege. ATC is included, enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Kalitta Air (CKS/K4)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-400BCF (B744)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard Kalitta Air\nEngines: 4x GE CF6-80C2B1F \nRegistration: N742CK\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) -  Liege (LGG)\nCallsign: Connie 525 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: September 11, 2017\nLocal time: 1800\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N742CK\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

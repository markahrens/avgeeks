 "name": "Low Pass! Spanish Air Force Lockheed C-130H-30 [TL.10-01] Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "On July 6th, YYC received three surprise military visitors from Germany, Spain, and France, bringing troops and equipment for NATO training at CFB Suffield, a Canadian Forces Base southeast of Calgary. This occurs every year, with it comes some interesting military visitors! As you've seen already, the Germans brought an A400M and the French brought an A340-200, while the Spanish brought a C-130. Here are the Spanish departing, with an impressive low pass and steep climb after clearing the runway! That was really quite a sight, I was expecting it rotate early, but not the pitch down after the rotation and low pass right in front of me. That steep climb was icing on the cake! Enjoy this special takeoff as much as I did witnessing it!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Spanish Air Force/Ejército del Aire (AME)\nAircraft: Lockheed C-130H-30 \"Hercules\" (C130)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Military grey\nRegistration: TL.10-01 \nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Joint Base Andrews (ADW)\nCallsign: Alpha Mike Echo 3106 (AME3106)\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: July 8, 2017\nLocal time: 0900\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

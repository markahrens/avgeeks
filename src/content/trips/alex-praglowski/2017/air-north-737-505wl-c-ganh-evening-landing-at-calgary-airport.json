 "name": "Air North 737-505(WL) [C-GANH] Evening Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Air North is one of YYC's lesser-known regular airlines, operating just 5 times a week from Whitehorse and on to Edmonton in the late evening. As you've seen on my channel in the past, they have a sole 737-200 that they rarely fly into YYC, but other times, they'll send one of their 4 737-500s or their sole 737-400. A 737-500 is still a fairly uncommon sight these days, so I believe it's worth sharing. ATC is included, enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air North (ANT/4N)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-500 (B735)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Revised\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-3C1 \nRegistration: C-GANH\nRoute: Whitehorse (YXY) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Air North 527\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: May 5, 2017\nLocal time: 2030\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGANH\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

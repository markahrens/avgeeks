 "description": "I've been looking through my archives lately, and I've got a ton of interesting catches from Tokyo-Narita that I never uploaded for some reason. Here's one of them, a now retired Jet Asia Airways 767-200ER departing for Bangkok. Jet Asia Airways is a Thai airline that operates only 767s to a number of destinations from Thailand. This particular airframe is now retired, but was actually a former Air Canada 767, sold in 2008!

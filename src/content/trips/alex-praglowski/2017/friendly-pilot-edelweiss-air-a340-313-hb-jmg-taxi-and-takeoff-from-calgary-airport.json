 "description": "This is a first for me, having a pilot actually open their window to wave! Here we have Edelweiss Air's beautiful A340-300 taxiing up close, with a very friendly captain giving the spotters a wave and thumbs up, and departing runway 17L for Zurich. A very cool sight and a nice gesture on behalf of this Edelweiss captain! ATC is included, hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Edelweiss Air (EDW/WK)\nAircraft: Airbus A340-300 (A343)\nAircraft Name: \"Melchsee-Frutt\"\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x CFMI CFM56-5C4/P \nRegistration: HB-JMG\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Zurich (ZRH)\nCallsign: Edelweiss One Five Juliet Heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: August 24, 2017\nLocal time: 1700\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/HBJMG\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

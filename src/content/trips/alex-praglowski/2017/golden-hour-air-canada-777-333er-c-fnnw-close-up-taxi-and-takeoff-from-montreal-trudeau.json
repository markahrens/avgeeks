 "description": "Air Canada is by far the largest airline at Montréal-Trudeau, the airport being one of AC's three main hubs (YYC is sort of a weird mix between hub and focus city). Here's one of the airline's busiest routes, Montréal to London, departing 24L at YUL in some gorgeous evening lighting on board one of the carrier's high density 77Ws, fin number 747, ironically.

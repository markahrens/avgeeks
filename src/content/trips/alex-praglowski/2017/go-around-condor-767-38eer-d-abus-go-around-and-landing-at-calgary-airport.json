 "name": "Go Around! Condor 767-38E(ER) [D-ABUS] Go-Around and Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Believe it or not, I have never actually filmed a go-around in Calgary before! I've seen them plenty of times here, just never when I happen to have my camera rolling. The WestJet 1860 low pass back in January was technically a go-around, but I don't count it since it was planned. This is actually Condor's final flight of the season, and I'm not 100% sure what the reason was. To me though, it looks like he was too high (note the nose-down attitude just before they pulled up) and called it off due to the unstable approach. The video includes the actual go-around, landing 10 minutes later, and taxiing to the gate. ATC is included throughout, including the go-around, enjoy this special catch!\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Condor Flugdienst (CFG/DE)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-300ERWL (B763)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New (2015 -)\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B6F \nRegistration: D-ABUS\nRoute: Frankfurt-Main (FRA) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Condor 438 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: September 1, 2017\nLocal time: 1730\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/DABUS\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

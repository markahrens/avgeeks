 "description": "Always nice to see a new airline here! Here we have the first flight of the season from VivaAerobús, a Mexican low-cost carrier operating the first charter this winter for Sunwing Vacations from San Jose del Cabo (SJD). The flight operates once a week, on Saturdays, until when, I'm not sure. VivaAerobús does have a few A320neos in their fleet; hopefully one of those makes an appearance! Enjoy my first catch of this airline, as well as its first ever visit to YYC Calgary International Airport, with ATC!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: VivaAerobús (VIV/VB)\nAircraft: Airbus A320-200 (A320)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x IAE V2527-A5 \nRegistration: XA-VAE\nRoute: San Jose del Cabo (SJD) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Aeroenlaces 7950\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: December 16, 2017\nLocal time: 1230\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/XAVAE\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "name": "Sun Country 737-73V [N710SY] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Sun Country is an occasional visitor to Calgary International Airport, operating some casino charters from Calgary and Edmonton to some airports in the US. Here we have one of said charters, operating Sun Country 8201 to Bullhead City, Arizona. This was actually shot the same day of the WestJet 767 emergency, prior to the actual event, so I guess I have this bird to thank for all the exposure that 767 video has gotten me.

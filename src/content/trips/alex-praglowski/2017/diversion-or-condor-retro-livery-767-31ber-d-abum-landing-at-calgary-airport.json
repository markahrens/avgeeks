 "name": "DIVERSION | Condor Retro Livery 767-31B(ER) [D-ABUM] Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Not exactly how I wanted to film Condor's retro livery for the first time! Today, Condor flight 453 from Vancouver to Frankfurt made an unscheduled diversion to Calgary due to a medical emergency on board. The aircraft was about an hour from YYC when it diverted, giving me ample time to get to the airport and film its fairly heavy arrival on 17L, considering it was only about 2 hours into its flight before diverting here. Even though Condor serves Calgary 3 times a week in the summer, I've never managed to see this livery before. My best wishes to the passenger. ATC is included.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Condor Flugdienst (CFG/DE)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-300ER (B763)\nAircraft Name: \"Achim\"\nLivery: Retro (1980s)\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B6F \nRegistration: D-ABUM\nRoute: Vancouver (YVR) - Calgary (YYC) - Frankfurt-Main (FRA)\nCallsign: Condor 453 heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: August 3, 2017\nLocal time: 1800\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/DABUM\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

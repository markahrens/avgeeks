 "name": "Aviation Photography - 2016 Slideshow",
 "description": "In 2016, I took a much greater interest in aviation photography. Not only is it (arguably) much easier, but it allowed me to capture some moments that just aren't possible or feasible with video. Here's a slideshow of my favorite pictures from 2016, including shots from YYC, YEG, YYZ, and YUL. If it seems like there's a lot of 787s, well, that's Calgary for you! I hope you enjoy, and if you like what you see, follow me on Instagram and Flickr for more!

 "name": "Hainan Airlines \"Kung Fu Panda\" 787-9 Dreamliner [B-7302] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "I was hoping this would happen ever since Hainan sent one of their regular livery 787-9s back in May! Here we have the newest of Hainan's (currently) 3 Kung Fu Panda themed aircraft arriving from Beijing and departing once again two hours later. Eventually there'll be 6 Kung Fu Panda planes total, and I can't wait to see the others! Hainan is upgrading the Calgary route to a 787-9 starting next March, but I certainly wasn't expecting to see a Kung Fu Panda bird so soon, it looks fantastic in person. This video includes the arrival, taxi to the gate, then close up taxi for departure and the takeoff back to Beijing. ATC is included (only for departure), hope you enjoy this awesome livery's first ever visit to Calgary!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Hainan Airlines (CHH/HU)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (B789)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Kung Fu Panda Yellow\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B\nRegistration: B-7302\nRoute: Beijing Capital (PEK) - Calgary (YYC) - Beijing Capital (PEK)\nCallsign: Hainan 7877/7978 heavy\nRunway used: 35R, 35R\nDate filmed: June 22, 2017\nLocal time: 1400, 1600\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

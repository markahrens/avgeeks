 "description": "Every two years, the Lethbridge International Air Show takes place in the city of Lethbridge, the 4th largest city in Alberta, located 2 hours south of Calgary. This year, aircraft such as the Lockheed C-5M Super Galaxy and Boeing C-17 Globemaster III were confirmed in the days leading up to the show, prompting me to make a trip down a day early to see these beasts arriving, along with all the other exciting aircraft slated to be on display. This was my first year attending the show, but I will definitely be attending in the coming years! This 40 minute compilation features most of the larger aircraft on static display along with most of the performers arriving at Lethbridge Airport on July 13 and 14, 2017. Sit back, relax, and enjoy all of these unique aircraft arriving, military or otherwise!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION\n00:11 - Vampire Airshows De Havilland DH-115 (N231BS)\n01:08 - \"Golden 8607\" - US Army Golden Knights Fokker C-31A (51607)\n03:02 - \"Aegis 71\" - USAF Lockheed C-130J Hercules (11-5748)\n05:08 - \"Reach 195\" - USAF Boeing C-17A Globemaster III (02-1104)\n07:34 - \"Fred 36\" - USAF Lockheed C-5M Super Galaxy (87-0034)\n16:47 - \"Snowbird 1 Flight\" - RCAF Snowbirds CT-114 Tutor (x9)\n19:10 - \"Heartbreak 201 Flight of 2\" - USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II (x2)\n24:14 - \"Hornet 01\" - RCAF CF-18 Demonstration Hornet (188734)\n25:02 - Nanchang CJ-6A (C-FGCJ)\n26:05 - \"Shadow 55\" - US Navy E-6B Mercury (164410)\n29:35 - \"Navy Lima Lima 808\" - US Navy P-8A Poseidon (169006)\n33:44 - \"Major 57\" - US Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey (03-8005)\n35:10 - \"Dragon 65\" - RCAF CT-155 Hawk (155221)\n36:15 - \"Reach 2098\" - USAF Boeing C-17 Globemaster III (02-1098)\n38:50 - \"Canforce 3649\" - RCAF Boeing CC-177 Globemaster III (177705)\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

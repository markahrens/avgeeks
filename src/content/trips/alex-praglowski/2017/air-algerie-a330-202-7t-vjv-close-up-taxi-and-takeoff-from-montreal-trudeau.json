 "description": "A pretty uncommon airline in North America! Air Algérie, the national airline of Algeria, operates several flights into Montreal, its only North American destination. Montreal itself is definitely unique in that it's the only city in Canada to have so many direct flights to Africa, on Air Algérie, Royal Air Maroc, and recently, Air Canada. Here we have one of of Air Algérie's flights taxiing up close and taking off on runway 24L!

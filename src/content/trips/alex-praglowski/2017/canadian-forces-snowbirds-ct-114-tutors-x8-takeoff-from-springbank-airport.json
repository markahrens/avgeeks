 "name": "Canadian Forces Snowbirds CT-114 Tutors (x8) Takeoff from Springbank Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "After the Wings Over Springbank Airshow, which took place from July 29-30, most of the performers left right away but the Canadian Forces Snowbirds, or at least, 8 of them, stayed behind for a few days afterward. Here they are departing Calgary's second airport, Springbank, for their next show, which I believe was in Quesnel, British Columbia. Enjoy this comprehensive video of all 8 aircraft starting up, taxiing, and departing!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

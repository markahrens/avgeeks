 "name": "Water Salute! WestJet Frozen Livery 737-8CT [C-GWSV] Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Water salutes are an especially rare occurrence at Calgary International Airport, for some reason. But this case was a fantastic gesture on behalf of the Calgary Airport Authority and WestJet Airlines for a special guest on board this flight from San Francisco today (June 25). I won't say any further details for the privacy of the passenger and their family, but regardless it's an amazing gesture. They had also attempted to fly over the airport prior to arrival but Calgary Arrival wasn't able make it work with other traffic. Regardless, well done to WestJet and Calgary International Airport! Enjoy this special video also with some kind wishes from the tower controllers for the passenger.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: WestJet (WJA/WS)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: \"Disney's Frozen\"\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-7B27 \nRegistration: C-GWSV\nRoute: San Francisco (SFO) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WestJet 1509\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: June 25, 2017\nLocal time: 1800\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

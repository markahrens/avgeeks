 "name": "Cargolux 747-4R7F [LX-WCV] Sunrise Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Cargolux Airlines International and Cathay Pacific Cargo are Calgary Airport's only scheduled 747 services, but they unfortunately operate out of daylight hours, with some exceptions due to delays at other airports along their route. This was one of those days, where CV775 to Luxembourg departed literally seconds before sunrise back in February. Made for an exceptionally late rotation as well!

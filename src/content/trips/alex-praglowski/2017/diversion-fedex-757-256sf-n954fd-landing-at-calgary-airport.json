 "name": "Diversion - FedEx 757-256SF [N954FD] Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "On March 29th, Edmonton International Airport had some heavy fog, which forced dozens of flights to hold near the airport, and some to divert. FedEx's weekly flight into Edmonton, FX120, was the only one to divert to Calgary, and I just happened to be out spotting. Pity there was no Air China Cargo that morning! It ended staying on the ground at YYC for eight hours, leaving that evening. 757s in the FedEx livery are a regular sight here, but they're operated by Morningstar with a Canadian registration, so this is kind of special.

 "description": "A bit of a flashback to some warmer weather! Here we have another regular carrier at Calgary International Airport that I haven't uploaded much of, North Cariboo Air (NCA). NCA is primarily a charter carrier, but does regular flights within Western Canada, primarily from Calgary and Edmonton to the Alberta Oil Sands for employees of the major oil companies up in Northern Alberta. Here's one of said flights arriving back at YYC in June, with ATC included! Hope you enjoy one of our more unique regulars here at YYC.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: North Cariboo Air (NCB)\nAircraft: Avro RJ100 (RJ1H)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x LY LF507-1F \nRegistration: C-FSUA\nRoute: Fort MacKay/Firebag (CYFI) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: North Cariboo 9971\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: June 3, 2017\nLocal time: 1100\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFSUA\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

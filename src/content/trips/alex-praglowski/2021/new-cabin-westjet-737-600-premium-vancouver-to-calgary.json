 "name": "NEW CABIN! WestJet 737-600 Premium Vancouver to Calgary",
 "description": "WestJet has been quietly storing its fleet of Boeing 737-600s in Marana, Arizona, over the past few months. Before this though, they reconfigured a single 737-600 with their new cabin that's now standard on the rest of their 737s - and I had the chance to fly it back in August last year!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-6CT (B736)\nFlight Number: WS126\nSeat: 3F\nLivery: Old\nEngines: 2x CFM56-7B22\nRegistration: C-GPWS\nRoute: Vancouver (YVR) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WESTJET 126\nRunway used: 26L (YVR) - 17R (YYC)\nDate filmed: August 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n#TallPeopleFlying\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

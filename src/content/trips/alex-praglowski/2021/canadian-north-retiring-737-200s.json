They'll be missed!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOURCES:\n\nCanadian North Retiring 737-200s:\nhttps://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/canadian-north-to-phase-out-jet-service-to-western-nunavut-hubs/\n\nC-GOPW History:\nhttps://www.planespotters.net/airframe/boeing-737-200-c-gopw-canadian-north/r6pq8m\n\nC-GDPA History:\nhttps://www.planespotters.net/airframe/boeing-737-200-c-gdpa-canadian-north/edz1l9\n\nFirst Air Hercules:\nhttps://www.routesonline.com/news/29/breaking-news/248470/first-air-and-lynden-air-cargo-cooperate-to-keep-hercules-flying-in-canada/\n\nNolinor Fleet Info:\nhttps://nolinor.com/en/aeronefs/boeing-737-200/\n\nhttps://wwwapps.tc.gc.ca/Saf-Sec-Sur/2/CCARCS-RIACC/RchSimp.aspx\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "name": "Buffalo Airways Lockheed L-188 Electra RARE VISIT to Calgary Airport!",
 "description": "This may very well be the catch of the year! Due to the ongoing crisis in B.C., quite a few additional cargo flights have taken place between Calgary and Vancouver.\n\nBuffalo Airways of \"Ice Pilots NWT\" has now joined these flights, bringing one of their Lockheed Electras all the way down from Yellowknife to carry some supplies to Vancouver!\n\nIt can't be overstated how exceedingly rare this is - yes, you could drive an hour north to Red Deer and see a dozen Electras on the ground, but to actually see one flying on one of Canada's busiest air routes is unheard of in 2021! Enjoy this rare Electra action!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video!

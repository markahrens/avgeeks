 "description": "Throughout 2020, Air Canada flew its fleet of 6 Boeing 777-200LRs to Victorville and Marana in the U.S. for storage, and after just over a year, some of these have flown back to Canada and re-entered service!\n\nOne visited Calgary on Christmas Day, and seeing as it was our first visit from an LR in 21 months or so, I think it’s worth a video. Enjoy this frigid 777 action!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video!

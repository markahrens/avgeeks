 "description": "Thank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video! Find out more about them at https://www.radarbox.com/?referrer=AlexAviation\n\nOn Friday, KLM sent their Boeing 787-10 to Calgary for the very first time, on a rare equipment swap. This also marks the first ever visit of the 787-10 in Calgary, as we only see regular flights with the 787-9 and the occasional 787-8.\n\nGreat to see it here and in the KLM livery, hopefully there'll be many more visits in the future!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM/KL)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-10 (B78X)\nFlight Number: KL678\nLivery: New \nEngines: GEnx-1B\nRegistration: PH-BKF\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Amsterdam (AMS)\nCallsign: KLM 678 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: April 16th 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

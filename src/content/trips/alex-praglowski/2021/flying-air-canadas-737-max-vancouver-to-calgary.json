 "description": "Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAXs finally returned to service earlier this year, after being grounded for nearly two years.\n\nI haven’t flown on the Air Canada MAX since before the grounding, when I flew it in Business from Toronto to Calgary back in August of 2018.\n\nSeeing as I haven’t tried it in Economy yet, I thought this might make for a more interesting late night flight!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 737 MAX 8 (B38M)\nFlight Number: AC228\nSeat: 13F (Economy)\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x CFM LEAP-1B\nRegistration: C-FSDB\nRoute: Vancouver (YVR) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: AIR CANADA 228\nRunway used: 26L (YVR) - 35L (YYC)\nDate filmed: August 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "description": "Back in December 2019, I flew Air Canada's 767 from Toronto to Orlando, in their Business Class! Little did I know at the time, it would actually be my very last flight on a mainline Air Canada 767,  as they were all retired just 6 months later.\n\nSeeing as it's been around a year now since these aircraft left passenger service, I thought I'd share that final flight with you all today!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-375(ER) (B763)\nFlight Number: AC908\nSeat: 8K (Business Class)\nLivery: Old (2005-2017)\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B6F\nRegistration: C-FTCA\nRoute: Toronto-Pearson (YYZ) - Orlando (MCO)\nCallsign: AIR CANADA 908 heavy\nRunway used: 06L (YYZ) - 35R (MCO)\nDate filmed: December 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n#TallPeopleFlying\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

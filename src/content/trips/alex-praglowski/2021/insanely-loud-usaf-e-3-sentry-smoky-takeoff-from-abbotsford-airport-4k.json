 "name": "INSANELY LOUD USAF E-3 Sentry SMOKY Takeoff from Abbotsford Airport! (4K)",
 "description": "On October 1st, this USAF E-3 Sentry arrived in Abbotsford, British Columbia, for the annual \"Girls Fly Too\" event. However, it didn't leave immediately after the event like the other USAF aircraft, and stayed for over a week.\n\nI happened to be nearby in Vancouver the day it was leaving, and I knew I had to take the chance to catch one of these militarized 707s, especially with the original engines!\n\nWith thanks to Brandon for driving me to Abbotsford in the first place lol.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video!

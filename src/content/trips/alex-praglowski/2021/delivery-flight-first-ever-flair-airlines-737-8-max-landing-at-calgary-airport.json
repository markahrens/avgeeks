 "description": "Thank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video! Find out more about them at https://www.radarbox.com/?referrer=AlexAviation\n\nBack in January, Flair Airlines announced that they had procured 13 Boeing 737 MAXs for an extensive expansion plan.\n\nThe first of these 737 MAXs was handed over to the airline today, and flew from Boeing Field to Calgary, making Flair Canada's fourth 737 MAX operator!\n\nIn doing so, the airline's also honouring their history a little bit - C-FLEJ was a former Boeing 737-400 registration, which has since been retired from the fleet.\n\nLooking forward to seeing more of these over the next few months!

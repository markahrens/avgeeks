 "name": "BOEING 747-8 FREIGHTER ACTION! Cargolux and Korean Air Cargo at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Thank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video! Find out more about them at https://www.radarbox.com/?referrer=AlexAviation\n\nAbout a year ago, two Boeing 747-8Fs paid a visit to Calgary International Airport - one from Korean Air Cargo, and another from Cargolux.\n\nThe Cargolux one was coming in on their regular scheduled service, but with a rare daylight arrival in some gorgeous sunset lighting. The Korean Air Cargo was a scheduled flight, departing in the early summer morning hours (around 5AM).\n\nBoth aircraft were quite a few hours apart in their visits, but it's still not often we get to see two of Boeing's largest freighter in daylight in the same day! Enjoy this 747-8F action.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION (Cargolux)\nAirline: Cargolux Airlines International (CLX/CV)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-8F (B748)\nFlight Number: CV46U\nLivery: 50th Anniversary\nEngines: 4x GEnx-2B67\nRegistration: LX-VCC\nRoute: Luxembourg (LUX) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: CARGOLUX 46 Uniform heavy\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: June 2020 \n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION (Korean Air Cargo)\nAirline: Korean Air Cargo (KAL/KE)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-8F (B748)\nFlight Number: KE9232\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x GEnx-2B67\nRegistration: HL7610\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Anchorage (ANC)\nCallsign: KOREAN AIR 9232 heavy\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: June 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

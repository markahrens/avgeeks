 "name": "HOCKEY CHARTER! TUI 787-8 Dreamliner Takeoff from Edmonton Airport (IIHF 2021)",
 "description": "Due to COVID-19, the 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championship was held in a modified fashion in Edmonton, Alberta. This involved a \"bubble\" strategy much like the 2020 NHL playoffs, with games behind closed doors and strict health protocols.\n\nWith the end of the tournament, Team Finland and Team Russia were headed home from Edmonton, and this TUI Airlines Netherlands 787-8 Dreamliner was chartered.\n\nTUI themselves are not at all a common sight in Alberta, aside from the occasional leased 737 to Sunwing, so it was worth the trip up! All filmed safely, of course.

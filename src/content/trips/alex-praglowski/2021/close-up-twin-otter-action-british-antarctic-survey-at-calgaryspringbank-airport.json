 "name": "CLOSE UP TWIN OTTER ACTION! British Antarctic Survey at Calgary/Springbank Airport",
 "description": "Calgary/Springbank Airport is Calgary's secondary airport, and mainly deals with flight training traffic. However, it's also home to a Twin Otter maintenance facility, meaning we sometimes see these special birds from the British Antarctic Survey, among other operators.\n\nEarlier this week, VP-FAZ flew up to Calgary after spending the summer in Antarctica, and will likely stay here until the fall for maintenance. Always nice to see a larger aircraft among the Cessnas, and on Springbank's least-used runway to boot!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nOperator: British Antarctic Survey\nAircraft: De Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter\nLivery: British Antarctic Survey Red\nEngines: 2x PT6A-34\nRegistration: VP-FAZ\nRoute: Casper (CPR) - Calgary (YYC) - Calgary/Springbank (YBW)\nCallsign: Victor Papa Foxtrot Alpha Zulu\nRunway used: 08\nDate filmed: March 16 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

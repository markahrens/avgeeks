 "name": "TEST FLIGHT! WestJet 737 MAX 8 Takeoff and Landing at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "As part of WestJet's 737 MAX return to service, they'll be doing test/validation flights on each of their aircraft before they fly any passengers.\n\nTentatively, they're hoping to return the aircraft to service as soon as January 21st, pending final approvals from Transport Canada.\n\nAlthough most of the WestJet MAX fleet is still down in the States, three aircraft stayed in Kelowna, and those are in Calgary now preparing to fly passengers again - C-FNAX, C-FRYV, and C-FHCM (as seen here).\n\nI sure missed the sound of those LEAPs! Ultimately, I think the MAX is now one of, if not the safest airliners and I'm looking forward to flying it again eventually. Enjoy the MAX action!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737 MAX 8 (B38M) \nFlight Number: WS8900\nLivery: New (2018) \nEngines: 2x CFM LEAP-1B\nRegistration: C-FHCM\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WESTJET 8900\nRunway used: 29 (departure) - 35R (arrival)\nDate filmed: January 14th, 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "name": "RARE VISITOR! French Bee Airbus A350-900 at Calgary Airport [4K]",
 "description": "Over the past few days, Calgary's been lucky enough to see this Airbus A350-900 from French Bee, a French low-cost airline!\n\nFrench Bee flies a route from Paris to Tahiti in French Polynesia, normally via San Francisco. Due to COVID though, they've switched that SFO stop to Vancouver for the past few months.\n\nRecently though, Vancouver has reportedly been having some fuel supply issues, and so French Bee has temporarily relocated that stopover to Calgary! Prior to this, we've only ever had one A350 in Calgary, so it's been an absolute pleasure seeing French Bee here. Enjoy this A350 footage filmed over the past few days.\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video!

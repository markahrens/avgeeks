 "description": "Cargolux is Calgary's only Boeing 747 operator, serving the city twice weekly with a mix of Boeing 747-400 and 747-8 Freighters.\n\nThis particular 747 joined the Cargolux fleet last year, and was painted in this striking 50th anniversary retro livery.\n\nCargolux in Calgary during the daytime is already a fairly rare occurrence, but seeing their retro 747 is just icing on the cake! Enjoy this retro 747 action. \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Cargolux Airlines International (CLX/CV)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-4EVF(ER)\nFlight Number: CV7745/CV7756\nLivery: 50th Anniversary Retro \nEngines: 4x GE CF6-80C2B5F\nRegistration: LX-NCL\nRoute: Seattle/Tacoma (SEA) - Calgary (YYC) - Luxembourg (LUX) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: CARGOLUX 46 Uniform Heavy\nRunway used: 17R / 17R / 35L\nDate filmed: March 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

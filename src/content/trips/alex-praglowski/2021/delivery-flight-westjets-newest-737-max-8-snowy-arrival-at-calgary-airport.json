 "name": "DELIVERY FLIGHT! WestJet's NEWEST 737 MAX 8 Snowy Arrival at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Welcome home, Tail 316! WestJet's 14th Boeing 737 MAX 8 was finally delivered to their Calgary base from Boeing Field on Friday evening, making it the carrier's first new delivery of a MAX since the grounding.\n\nC-GWLK first flew in October of 2019, but had been stored with Boeing for well over a year, for obvious reasons. Great to see a new delivery after so long, and in some surprisingly nice snowy conditions. Plus, one more to add to the list of WestJet aircraft in the new livery! \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737 MAX 8 (B38M)\nFlight Number: WS8964\nLivery: New (2018)\nEngines: 2x CFM LEAP-1B\nRegistration: C-GWLK\nRoute: Seattle-Boeing Field (BFI) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WESTJET 8964\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: February 12th, 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "description": "Last weekend, Calgary got this special visitor from the Royal Air Force, the first one in quite a few months!\n\nNormally, we get a good number of RAF aircraft coming through Calgary thanks to the training that they do in Southern Alberta.\n\nObviously that's not a thing at the moment, or at least not on the pre-2020 scale, but it's great to see the Brits again! Enjoy this A400M footage!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nOperator: Royal Air Force (RRR)\nAircraft: Airbus A400M Atlas (A400) \nFlight Number: RRR4080/4081\nLivery: RAF Grey\nEngines: 4x Europrop TP400-D6\nRegistration: ZM410\nRoute: Keflavik (KEF) - Calgary (YYC) - Brize Norton (BZZ)\nCallsign: ASCOT 4080/4081 heavy\nRunway used: 17R/35L\nDate filmed: February 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

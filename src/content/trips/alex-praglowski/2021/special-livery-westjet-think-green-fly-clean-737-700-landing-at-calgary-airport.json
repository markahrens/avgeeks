 "description": "Thank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video! Find out more about them at https://www.radarbox.com/?referrer=AlexAviation\n\nBack in November, this WestJet 737-700 mysteriously relocated to Chicago-Rockford Airport for several months, undergoing a couple test flights there.\n\nIt flew back to Canada earlier this week, with some structural modifications made to the rear wing root and the flap track fairings, along with some titles - \"Think Green Fly Clean\", and \"Aero Design Labs\".\n\nWhat's odd is that there's been pretty much no public information on this project. However, Aero Design Labs is a company that's \"focused on drag reduction\" (https://www.jsfirm.com/Aero+Design+Labs/19557/companyprofile) so presumably this 737 has been acting as a test bed of sorts.\n\nEither way, kind of an interesting catch, and (sort of) a new special livery for Canadian spotters to keep an eye on!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-7CT (B73G)\nFlight Number: WS8966\nLivery: Think Green, Fly Clean \nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-7B24 \nRegistration: C-GUWJ\nRoute: Dallas Love Field (DAL) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WESTJET 8966\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: May 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

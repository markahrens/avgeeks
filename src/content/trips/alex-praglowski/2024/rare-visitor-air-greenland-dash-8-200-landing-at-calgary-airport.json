 "name": "RARE VISITOR! Air Greenland Dash 8-200 Landing at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Last Saturday, this Dash 8-200 from Air Greenland flew into Calgary! \n\nAir Greenland is an extremely rare sight here, and this Dash 8 came for a C-Check, flying here from Nuuk via Iqaluit and Churchill, and will probably be here for at least a few weeks.\n\nIt landed on 17L, taxiied to Apron 6, and then started up again to taxi over to Avmax, who's doing the work.\n\nAfter seeing their A330 in Fort Mac last year, I didn't think I would see one of their smaller Dash 8s right at home, so this was quite the treat!

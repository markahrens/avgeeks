 "name": "CRAZY Plane Spotting in ST. MAARTEN! Princess Juliana International Airport (4K)",
 "description": "Princess Juliana International Airport (TNCM/SXM) on the Dutch side of the island of Saint Martin/Sint Maarten is arguably one of the most famous airports in the world. \n\nMaho Beach, situated very close to the runway 10 threshold, is an iconic location for plane spotting, with low landings, waving pilots, and of course some jet and prop blast if you're brave enough to stand right behind planes as they take off.\n\nI spent a week there in February 2023, and filmed this hour-long video from various points on Maho Beach, with a few other clips from a 10th floor, \"Signature Island View\" room at the Sonesta Maho Beach Resort.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPraglowski\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - Silver ATR 42 from San Juan (SJU)\n00:00:37 - Winair DHC-6 to Saint Barthélemy (SBH)\n00:01:12 - Air Antilles ATR 42 to Curaçao (CUR)\n00:02:14 - Netjets Global 6000 to West Palm Beach (PBI)\n00:03:28 - Air Transat A321neo from Toronto (YYZ)\n00:04:09 - Silver ATR 42 to San Juan (SJU)\n00:05:03 - Winair DHC-6 from Saint Barthélemy (SBH)\n00:05:28 - JetBlue A321 from Boston (BOS)\n00:06:07 - Jet Edge Challenger 300 to Nassau (NAS)\n00:07:23 - Private Gulfstream G600 from São Paulo (GRU)\n00:08:07 - Anguilla Air Services Trislander to The Valley (AXA)\n00:08:40 - United 737 from Newark (EWR)\n00:09:06 - Private Gulfstream G550 takeoff\n00:10:20 - Delta 757 from New York (JFK)\n00:10:56 - Private Falcon 900EX takeoff\n00:12:21 - Air Transat A321neo to Toronto (YYZ)\n00:13:54 - JetBlue A321 to Boston (BOS)\n00:15:16 - United 737 to Newark (EWR)\n00:16:35 - Delta 757 from Atlanta (ATL)\n00:17:13 - Air France A330 from Paris (CDG)\n00:17:58 - WestJet 737 from Toronto (YYZ)\n00:18:26 - JetBlue A321 to New York (JFK)\n00:20:04 - KLM A330 from Amsterdam (AMS)\n00:20:46 - American A319 to Miami (MIA)\n00:22:09 - TBM-850 from Fort Lauderdale (FLL)\n00:22:34 - Delta 757 to Atlanta (ATL)\n00:24:06 - American 737 from Miami (MIA)\n00:24:31 - Jetair Caribbean Fokker 70 from Curaçao (CUR)\n00:25:33 - Lyon Aviation Falcon 50EX takeoff\n00:27:12 - Winair DHC-6 to Saint Barthélemy (SBH)\n00:27:41 - Anguilla Air Services Trislander to The Valley (AXA)\n00:28:42 - WestJet 737 to Toronto (YYZ)\n00:30:31 - St. Barth Commuter C208B to Saint Barthélemy (SBH)\n00:31:41 - Air Antilles ATR 42 to Pointe-a-Pitre (PTP)\n00:32:32 - American 737 to Miami (MIA)\n00:33:11 - Air France A330 to Paris (CDG)\n00:34:21 - KLM A330 to Amsterdam (AMS)\n00:35:40 - Amerijet 757 to St. Kitts (SKB)\n00:38:02 - Air Flamenco Short 360 from San Juan (SJU)\n00:38:51 - Air Flamenco Short 360 to San Juan (SJU)\n00:39:27 - Jetair Caribbean Fokker 70 to Curaçao (CUR)\n00:41:51 - Air France A330 to Paris (CDG)\n00:42:36 - Qatar Amiri Flight A340-500\n00:43:29 - Air Cargo Carriers Short 360 from San Juan (SJU)\n00:44:06 - Qatar Amiri Flight A340-500 to Miami (MIA)\n00:47:54 - Amerijet 757 from Miami (MIA)\n00:48:34 - Caribbean Airlines 737 MAX from Port of Spain (POS)\n00:49:22 - United 737 from Washington (IAD)\n00:49:47 - Bombardier Global 7500 from Berlin (BER)\n00:50:18 - Delta 757 from New York (JFK) \n00:50:49 - Caribbean Airlines 737 MAX to Kingston (KIN)\n00:52:17 - Air Transat A321neo to Montreal (YUL)\n00:54:45 - LIAT ATR 42 from Beef Island (EIS)\n00:55:17 - Delta 767 from Atlanta (ATL)\n00:56:21 - Air France A330 from Paris (CDG)\n00:57:09 - United 737 to Newark (EWR)\n00:58:08 - American 737 from Miami (MIA)\n00:59:16 - Spirit A320neo from Fort Lauderdale (FLL)\n00:59:58 - Arajet 737 MAX to Santo Domingo (SDQ)\n01:01:22 - Air France A330 from Paris (CDG)\n01:01:47 - Air Canada 737 MAX to Toronto (YYZ)\n01:03:09 - KLM A330 to Amsterdam (AMS)\n01:04:06 - Outro\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2024\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

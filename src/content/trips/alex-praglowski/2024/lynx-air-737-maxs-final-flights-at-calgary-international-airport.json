 "name": "Lynx Air 737 MAXs - Final Flights at Calgary International Airport",
 "description": "During the last weekend of February, Lynx Air wound down their operations and steadily got their fleet of nine Boeing 737 MAXs back to their base in Calgary.\n\nAfter flying their last passenger flights, all nine of their planes were briefly parked at Calgary International Airport for just a few days.\n\nOn February 29th though, the nine airplanes flew again one more time, ferrying to Tucson, Arizona, for further storage.\n\nSo, as one last little tribute to Lynx Air, here's a compilation of some of their final revenue flights, as well as a few of the ferry flights, including the last ever departure from Calgary.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPraglowski\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\n00:00 - Intro\n00:30 - C-GUUL departing to Vancouver (YVR)\n02:33 - C-GUUL landing from Vancouver (YVR)\n03:55 - C-GLYX landing from Montreal (YUL)\n04:31 - C-FTHF, C-GUUL, C-GLYX parked\n04:48 - C-GULN landing from Hamilton (YHM)\n05:39 - C-GULN, C-FTHF, C-GUUL parked\n05:46 - C-GLYX, C-GUUL parked\n06:00 - C-GUUL departing to Tucson (TUS)\n07:13 - C-GJSL departing to Tucson (TUS)\n09:36 - C-FULI departing to Tucson (TUS)\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2024\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

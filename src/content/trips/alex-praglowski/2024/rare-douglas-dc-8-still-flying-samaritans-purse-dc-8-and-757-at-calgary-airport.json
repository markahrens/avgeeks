  "name": "RARE VISITOR! Air Greenland Dash 8-200 Landing at Calgary Airport",
  "description": "Yesterday, Calgary International Airport got perhaps the rarest visit of the year. Humanitarian organization Samaritan's Purse brought in their Boeing 757 and their Douglas DC-8, which is one of the last ones flying in the world!\n\nThe 757 is a fairly recent addition to their operation, but the DC-8 has been flying with them since 2016.\n\nThis 55-year-old DC-8-72 Combi first entered service with Finnair in 1969, and also flew with the French Air Force and Air Transport International before being purchased by Samaritan's Purse.\n\nBoth planes were here bringing in an Emergency Field Hospital to their warehouse here in Calgary. The hospital and its supplies will be based here and ready to be deployed by their Canadian division.\n\nWith barely any DC-8s still flying around the world, and NASA retiring theirs in the next few months, the plane itself is an extremely rare sight.\n\nTo see one of these in operation in 2024, right at home, was pretty unbelievable, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPraglowski\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION (757)\nAirline: Samaritan's Purse (NSP)\nAircraft: Boeing 757-225(PCF) (B752)\nFlight Number: NSP7\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Rolls Royce RB211-535E4\nRegistration: N783SP\nRoute: Greensboro (GSO) - Calgary (YYC) - Greensboro (GSO)\nCallsign: SAM PURSE 7 / SAM'S PURSE 7 (?)\nRunway used: 35R, 35L\nDate filmed: March 2024\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION (DC-8)\nAirline: Samaritan's Purse (NSP)\nAircraft: Douglas DC-8-72CF\nFlight Number: NSP8\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x CFMI CFM56-2C1\nRegistration: N782SP\nRoute: Greensboro (GSO) - Calgary (YYC) - Greensboro (GSO)\nCallsign: SAM PURSE 8 / SAM'S PURSE 8 (?)\nRunway used: 35R, 35L\nDate filmed: March 2024\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2024\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

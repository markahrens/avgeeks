 "name": "I Flew on one of the LAST Dash 7s in the WORLD!",
 "description": "The De Havilland Canada Dash 7 is one of most unique airliners ever built. Able to seat up to 50 passengers with unbeatable STOL capabilities, it quickly found a niche operating into challenging airports with short runways. These days though, only a handful of them are left flying.\n\nHowever, in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, is the world's largest civilian Dash 7 operator: Air Tindi. Back in July last year, they let me come along on one of their occasional scheduled flights with this rare quad-turboprop, down to Hay River and back!\n\nA big, big thank you to Air Tindi for making this possible: https://airtindi.com/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPraglowski\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Tindi (TIN/8T)\nAircraft: De Havilland Canada Dash 7-103 (DHC7)\nFlight Number: 8T242/243\nSeat: 2A/11D\nLivery: New\nEngines: 4x Pratt & Whitney PT6A-50\nRegistration: C-FPBJ\nRoute: Yellowknife (YZF) - Hay River (YHY) - Yellowknife (YZF)\nCallsign: TINDI 242/243\nRunway used: 10 (YZF) - 14/32 (YHY) - 34 (YZF)\nDate filmed: July 2023\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2024\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "description": "Hey everyone, this is my very first Flight Simulator X Movie, and it's a tribute to US Airways, which is merging with American Airlines. Since it's my first FSX Movie, it's not very good, but I'm learning as I go. I hope you enjoy, and please comment, rate, and subscribe!\n\nMusic is \"Decline\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n\nADDONS USED:\nSunSkyJet KPHL\nThomas Ruth A330-200\nVistaliners 737-400\nPremier Aircraft Design Embraer E-190\nProject Opensky/SkySpirit 767-200\nProject Airbus A320\nQualityWings 757-200\nEzdok\nProject Opensky 737-800\n\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013",

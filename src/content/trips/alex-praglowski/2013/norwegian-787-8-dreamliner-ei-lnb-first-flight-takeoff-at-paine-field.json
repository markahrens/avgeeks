 "description": "Hello fellow youtubers, I'm back!\nSorry for the lack of activity this past week. I was on vacation, and I went to Seattle! I have about 4 hours of footage from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Boeing Field, and Paine Field, although most of the footage is from Paine. I tried a bit of spotting at Sea-Tac, but that didn't go so well, as I was having difficulty finding a good spot. I have much more coming, so stay tuned ;)\n\nEnjoy this footage of a Norwegian Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner departing Paine Field on its maiden flight!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/EILNB\nAircraft registration: EI-LNB\nCallsign: Boeing 577 Heavy\nRunway used: 34L\n_____________________________________________________\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

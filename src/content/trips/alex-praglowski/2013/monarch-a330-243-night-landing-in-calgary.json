 "description": "Hey everyone, this is a Monarch Airlines Airbus A330 landing at Calgary International Airport, from London Gatwick. Monarch used to have a seasonal service to YYC, but stopped it a few years ago for some reason. Nice to see it here again, even if it's just a one-time thing. Hope you enjoy! :D\n\nThanks for watching!

 "description": "Happy Heavy Aircraft Friday!\nHere we have a FedEx Airbus A300 landing at Calgary International Airport, arriving from Memphis. I know I screwed up the filming right at the best part, but I still decided to upload it, since I have no footage of A300s landing anyway.\n\nThanks for watching!

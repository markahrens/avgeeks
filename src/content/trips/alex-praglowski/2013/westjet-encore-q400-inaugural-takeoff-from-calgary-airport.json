 "description": "Hey everyone, this is the VERY FIRST commercial flight of Westjet Encore taking off from Calgary International Airport, bound for Nanaimo. This bird (at the time of uploading) had only been with WestJet for 10 days! This was also my first time seeing one of Westjet's Q400s in the air, so this was really awesome to see. I hope you enjoy, and please comment, rate, and subscribe!\n\nThis is one of my older uploads. Please check out my channel for much higher quality videos.\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: None yet (probably because it's so new)\nAircraft registration: C-FHEN\nCallsign: Encore 3109\nRunway used: 16\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013",

 "description": "Hey everyone, this is a short time lapse video of some of the work going on at Paine Field (KPAE/PAE). In the 5 minute time frame that I recorded this, the workers opened the cowlings on a Hainan Airlines 787, which I thought was pretty cool. I hope you enjoy the video :)\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nMusic is \"Take a Chance\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

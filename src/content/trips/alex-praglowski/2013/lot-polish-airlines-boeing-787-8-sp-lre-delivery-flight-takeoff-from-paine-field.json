 "description": "Dedicated to TheSamoloot! Check out his channel here: www.youtube.com/thesamoloot\nHey everyone, this is the delivery flight of LOT Polish Airline's fifth 787 departing Paine Field for Warsaw, Poland (EPWA/WAW). This was shot with a DSLR camera, which is meant for pictures, so the quality isn't the same as my normal spotting videos. Sorry for the shakiness as well. I hope you'll still enjoy it!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/SPLRE\nAircraft registration: SP-LRE\nCallsign: LOT ????

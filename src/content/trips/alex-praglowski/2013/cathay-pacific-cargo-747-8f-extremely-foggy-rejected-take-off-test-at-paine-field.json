 "description": "There's only one thing that's bad about Paine Field...\nThe fog. \nIf you look really closely, you can see that this video contains a Cathay Pacific Cargo 747-8F doing a rejected take-off (RTO) test at Paine Field. I know it's an RTO because at the very last millisecond that the plane is visible at, you can see the spoilers go up, and then you can hear the sound of the thrust reversers too.\n\nI'd also like to dedicate this video to YouTube user CathayA340! Please check out his channel and subscribe to him!\nCathayA340's channel here: http://www.youtube.com/CathayA340\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/BLJC\nAircraft registration: B-LJC\nCallsign: Boeing ????

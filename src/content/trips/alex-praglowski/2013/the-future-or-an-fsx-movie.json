 "description": "The future is bright for aviation. New aircraft, new technologies, new levels of comfort for passengers.\nWith that, however, we must say goodbye to some old friends who served us well.\n\nAfter a month of painstaking editing and perfecting, finally - here's my entry for FSXAviation1 and 1506jet's video contest. I tried really hard to make this my best FSX movie yet, so I hope you guys enjoy! \n\nUPDATE: It won second place ;)\n\nPlease note that my newer FSX movies are much better, IMO.\n\nThanks for watching!

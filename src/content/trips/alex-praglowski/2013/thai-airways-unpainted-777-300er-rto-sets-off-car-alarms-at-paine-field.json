 "description": "2x GE-90s + parking lot full of cars = ... I'm sure you can guess the outcome :)\nYou can hear the alarms going off right after the crew slams on the brakes. And by \"slams on the brakes\", I mean it. If you look at around 1:59-2:00, you can see the entire aircraft jolt forward, putting a lot of force on the nose gear. I did a few slow-motion replays at the end so you can see just how powerful the braking was. Hope you enjoy! :)\n\nThanks for watching!

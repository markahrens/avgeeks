 "name": "National Airlines 747-428/BCF Smooth landing in Calgary ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "This is a National Air Cargo Boeing 747-428/BCF landing at Calgary International Airport from Gander, Newfoundland. This bird was carrying horses for the horse show in Spruce Meadows, Alberta. The flight originated in Liege, Belgium, and then it flew to Gander for a short stopover (probably to feed the horses or something like that) and then on to Calgary. The pilots sure did an excellent job of putting the plane down smoothly! I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe!

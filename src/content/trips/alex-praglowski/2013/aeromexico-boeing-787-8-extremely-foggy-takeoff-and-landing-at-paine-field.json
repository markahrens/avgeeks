 "description": "Here we have an AeroMexico Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner taking off and landing at Paine Field. As you can see in the video, it was very foggy and hard to see anything, so I'm sorry for the lack of approach footage in the landing part of the video. Anyway, I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

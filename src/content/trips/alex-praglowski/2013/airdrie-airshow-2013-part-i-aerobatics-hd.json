 "description": "*****PLEASE READ!*****\nThis is Part 1 of 3 videos I have featuring footage from Day 2 of the 2013 Airdrie Regional Airshow. Part 1 features Sean D. Tucker in the Oracle Challenger III as well as Eric Hansen and Ken Fowler.\n\nThis is also my first video shot in 1080p! Yes, I know all of my previous videos can be watched in 1080p, but that doesn't mean the actual footage itself is Full HD. It was only being exported in 1080p, but the footage itself was being shot in 540p. My camera has this setting where you can either shoot in 1080p or just plain old 540p. The 540p option makes it easier to edit the videos, but the 1080p option means that I had to convert the files into another format that I could import into iMovie and edit. However, I didn't have any video converter software, so when I first started making videos, I decided to go the easier route and just go with the 540p option. However, for this airshow I decided to purchase a video converter so I could film in HD, and I think it turned out quite well! I still have a TON of older 540p videos that I need to upload, but the videos I film from this point on will be in actual full HD. Thanks for reading, now watch the video ;)\n\nThanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed the video.

 "description": "This is an older upload of mine. Please visit my channel for much better videos.\n\nHey everyone, this is the 5th plane spotting compilation from dude8472productions, and this one features various overhead landings at Calgary International Airport (CYYC/YYC). There isn't anything too special in this compilation, other than a British Airways 767-300 and a FedEx 757-200. Anyway, I hope you enjoy, and stay tuned for much more content!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2013\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "name": "Cargolux 747-8R7F [LX-VCC] Crosswind Overhead Landing at Calgary [HD]",
 "description": "When I first discovered this new spot, I thought to myself: \"I wonder what a Cargolux 747 would be like from this spot...\" And now I know. Really quite a thrill to be so close to a 747-8 flying over, even if it's so quiet, too. It was also exciting because it came in extremely early, and it's very rare to see Cargolux in daylight. I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe!

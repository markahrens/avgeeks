 "description": "This is a video of an Aerosvit Ukrainian Airlines Boeing 767-300ER landing at Warsaw. This flight was a LOT Polish Airlines flight operated by Aerosvit. This 767 was leased from Aerosvit by LOT to replace the plane that was written off in a belly landing at Warsaw about 9 months before. Registration UR-AAH. There isn't any video of the same plane taking off from Toronto as it was midnight and you couldn't really see anything.

 "name": "10 overheads at Calgary International Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "For today's video, I decided to compile the best overhead clips that I've shot so far. They're mostly clips that you've seen before, but my intent was for you to listen to that \"WHOOSH\" sound when the planes passed above my head again and again. I hope you enjoy the video as well as the engine sounds :)\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe!

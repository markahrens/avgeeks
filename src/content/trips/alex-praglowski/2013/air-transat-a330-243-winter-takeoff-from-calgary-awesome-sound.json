 "description": "Hey everybody, I went spotting yesterday and tried out a new spot. It's pretty close to the action but there's a fence so I don't exactly get a panoramic view, as you can see in the ending. The engine sounds from here are amazing though, just listen to those RR Trents howling on spool-up! Imagine hearing GE-90s from here ;) Hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

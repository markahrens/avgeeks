 "description": "Well, I screwed up the panning on this one... But it's a 767 so I thought I might as well upload it. This is one of the last few LAX videos I have to upload, and many more Paine Field videos will be coming!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: None\nAircraft registration: Unknown\nCallsign: Air Canada ????

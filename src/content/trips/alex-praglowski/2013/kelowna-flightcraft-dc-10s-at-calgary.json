 "description": "Hello everyone, this is a compilation of Kelowna Flightcraft DC-10-30 Freighters taking off and landing at Calgary International Airport. Kelowna Flightcraft only has 2 DC-10s in service, so it's not that much of a variety. They do have 2 more in storage, but I don't know when those will come back to service. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this 4-minute video of classic DC-10 action!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: None\nAircraft registration: C-GKFB\n\nFlightAware: None\nAircraft registration: C-GKFD\n_____________________________________________________\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

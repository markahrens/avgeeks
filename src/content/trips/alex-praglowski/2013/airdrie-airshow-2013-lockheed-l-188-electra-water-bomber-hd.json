 "description": "Hey everyone, this is Part 2 in a 3 part series of videos from the 2013 Airdrie Regional Airshow. Part 2 features a Lockheed L-188 Electra Water Bomber taking off, dropping some water for the spectators, and then landing. This was pretty exciting for me as well, because I've never seen a Lockheed Electra before.\n\nThanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed the video. Please comment, rate, and subscribe!\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "description": "Well, well, well! It looks like ol' St. Nick finally traded in that sleigh for something a bit bigger! Lol :) \n\nThis one was kind of rare... But the video kinda sucked :/\nI was busy filming an Air Transat A330 departing when I heard something big, and lo and behold, there it was, a BA 767 with a red nose! I hope you enjoy this video, even though it's not my best  :/\n\nThanks for watching!

 "description": "LONG VERSION HERE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrM8-iOcv-g\n\nThis is the delivery flight of American Airlines' 9th Boeing 777-300ER departing Paine Field (KPAE/PAE) for Dallas Fort-Worth International Airport. The video features the taxi, engine start, and takeoff. It was very foggy as you can see in the video, so the quality may not be great. I also met a fellow spotter that day, CphSpotting! Check out his video of this bird here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVOEyn1rcws\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N725AN\nAircraft registration: N725AN\nCallsign: American 8???

 "description": "Hey everyone, this is a Cargolux Airlines International Boeing 747-4R7F landing at Calgary International Airport, lumbering in on Runway 16. I tried to enhance the footage a bit so you can see more of the plane, so I apologize if you don't like the way it looks... From this spot, you really get a sense of the sheer size of the 747-400 (especially when you compare it to the 737s and A320s that came in before it)! I hope you enjoy, and please comment, rate, and subscribe!\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: None\nAircraft registration: Unknown\nCallsign: Cargolux 775 Heavy\nRunway used: 16\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013",

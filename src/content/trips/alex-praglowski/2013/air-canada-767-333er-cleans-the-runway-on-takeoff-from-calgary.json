 "description": "Happy Heavy Aircraft Friday!\nHere's an Air Canada Boeing 767-300ER departing Calgary International Airport for Tokyo/Narita for all of you! The spool-up sound from the 767s is just awesome! He sure cleaned the runway! This is another one of my older videos, and sorry for the shakiness, I didn't have my tripod. I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFTCA\nAircraft registration: C-FTCA\nCallsign: Air Canada 10 Heavy\nRunway used: 16\n_____________________________________________________\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

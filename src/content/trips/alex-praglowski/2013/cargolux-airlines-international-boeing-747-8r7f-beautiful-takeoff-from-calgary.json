 "description": "Hey everyone, this is a Cargolux Airlines International Boeing 747-8F departing Calgary bound for Luxembourg. This bird was very late because at the time I filmed it, it was already 1:00 PM, when these normally come in 12 hours earlier! Sorry for all the haze in the video too. I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe!

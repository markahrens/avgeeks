 "description": "Two Paine Field videos in one day! :D\nHere's one of Boeing's 747-400LCFs or \"Dreamlifters\" landing at Paine Field in Everett, WA. It was always a pleasure to see these birds when I was there. They may not have the lines of a regular 747 but they're still awesome to look at (mainly because you're wondering how the heck does this thing fly, lol). Hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

 "description": "Hey everyone, this is my departure from Los Angeles International Airport, onboard an Embraer E-190. Just as I got into my seat, I saw that KLM 747 taxiing, so I immediately got out my camera and started filming. Sorry about the break in the video right after I zoom in on the \"Hobbit Jet\" parked at a remote stand. I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFLWE\nAircraft registration: C-FLWE\nCallsign: Air Canada ????\nRunway used: 24L\n_____________________________________________________\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "description": "Happy Heavy Aircraft Friday!\nHey everyone, this is the delivery flight of TAM Airlines' 9th Boeing 777-300ER, departing Paine Field in Everett, Washington, bound for Brazil. Listen to those engines! That's one of my favorite things about my spot at Paine Field - You're so close to the planes that you can really feel the rumble in your chest when those GE-90s spool up! I hope you enjoy :D\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/PTMUI\nAircraft registration: PT-MUI\nCallsign: TAM 8???

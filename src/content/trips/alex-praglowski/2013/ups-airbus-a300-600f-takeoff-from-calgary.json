 "name": "UPS Airbus A300-600F Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Hey everyone, this is a United Parcel Service Airbus A300-600F departing Calgary International Airport, bound for Sioux Falls. Normally UPS flies a 767-300F on this route, but sometimes they'll switch to the A300, which is always nice to see. The A300 really looks quite beautiful when it's climbing, doesn't it?\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe!

 "description": "2013's been an amazing year of plane spotting at Calgary International Airport. I've discovered new spots, seen so many new planes, and met a lot of other spotters. This is also my 100th YYC plane spotting video. Let's see if I can get 100 more in 2014 ;)\n\nPlease note that this video is only a brief reflection on my spotting adventures in Calgary - I'll make a special video combining videos from the airports I've been to :)\n\nThanks for watching!

 "description": "Another very old video that I shot back in February when I went to California. Here's one of only 2 Northrop YF-23 fighters sitting at the Western Museum of Flight in Los Angeles. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get closer because the museum told me that there was a wasp nest in one of the engines (fail). Hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

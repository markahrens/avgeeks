 "name": "Low Landing! B-17G Flying Fortress [N5017N] Arriving at Springbank Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "The Experimental Aircraft Association, or EAA, brought their Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress to Calgary's Springbank Airport a couple weeks ago, where it flew a number of short flights around the area for some lucky passengers for the low price of $700 Canadian. On its last day, it did one more passenger flight, and here it is arriving, making a nice bank onto the approach for runway 35.

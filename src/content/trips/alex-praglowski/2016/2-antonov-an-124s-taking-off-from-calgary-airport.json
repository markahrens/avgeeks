 "description": "Follow me on Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude847...\n\nA very rare sight! These two Antonov 124s belonging to Antonov Airlines and Volga-Dnepr both took off from Calgary International Airport within 30 minutes of each other today. Both were carrying several spools of flex-pipe used for oil and gas gathering, bound for Saudi Arabia through Gander and Leipzig. I don't believe YYC has ever had this many An-124s here in a week (There were also two other Volga-Dnepr aircraft that I didn't catch). Enjoy these two massive Ukrainian birds taking to the skies.\n\nADB takeoff at 2:16\nVDA takeoff at 5:35\n\nThanks for watching!

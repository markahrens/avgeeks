 "name": "YYC Calgary International Airport 2016 - A Year of New Beginnings ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "2016 was a fantastic year for YYC Calgary International Airport! With a new service to Beijing, China on Hainan Airlines, the restart of Edelweiss Air's seasonal link to Zurich, Switzerland, and the announcement of AeroMexico's return in June, YYC has lots to look forward to. We also had some unique visitors, like having 5 Antonov 124s come during one week in February, the Bombardier CSeries (twice!), and the usual slew of Royal Air Force A330s! In addition, WestJet welcomed their 3rd and 4th 767s into their fleet, and launched services to London-Gatwick. Along with that, Calgary's new International Terminal opened for business, and I met lots of new people who are just as crazy about this hobby as I am! 2016 was an incredible year for spotting here in Calgary, and I'm looking forward to what 2017 will bring!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nMusic is \"Ryno's Theme\" by Kevin Macleod (incompetech.com)\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

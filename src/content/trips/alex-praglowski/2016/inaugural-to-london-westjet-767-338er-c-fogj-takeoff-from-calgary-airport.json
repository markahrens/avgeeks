 "name": "INAUGURAL TO LONDON - WestJet 767-338ER [C-FOGJ] Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "On May 6th 2016, WestJet started a new chapter in its history, launching three new routes to London's Gatwick airport, one from Toronto which will operate daily, one from Vancouver, which will operate 6x a week and one from Calgary (as seen here) which will operate 5x a week. Edmonton will receive flights 2x a week starting May 7th, as will Winnipeg 1x a week. Fittingly, Calgary's flight numbers are WS1 outbound and WS2 inbound, being the city that they started operations in 20 years ago, in addition to the flight being operated by their first 767.

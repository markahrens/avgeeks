 "description": "Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all of my viewers! At the beginning of December, I and a couple other enthusiasts spent a night at the brand new In-Terminal Marriott at YYC Calgary International Airport. Fueled by caffeine and plane spotter's adrenaline, we took tons of great photos and had a fantastic time. In this 12 minute long time lapse, composed of 11 hours of footage, you can see the airport settle down for the night and then ramp right back up the next morning. Some interesting points are noted below. Enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n03:00 - The Air Canada 787-9 prepares for departure.\n07:40 - An Transat A330 pushes back and taxis away.\n08:50 - In the middle of the night, a Cargolux 744 taxis by and takes off on 35R.\n09:35 - As the sun rises, action at the airport ramps up yet again.\n10:40 - The Air Transat A310 departs, promptly followed by a Cathay Pacific 747-8F.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nMusic is \"Ambiment\" by Kevin Macleod (incompetech.com)\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

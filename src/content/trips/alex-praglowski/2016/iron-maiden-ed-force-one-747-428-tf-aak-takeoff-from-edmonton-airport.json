 "description": "As part of their Book of Souls World Tour, heavy metal band Iron Maiden played in Edmonton on Friday April 8th, leaving the next day for its next concert in Vancouver. Needless to say, I was there ;) This video includes some close up shots of the aircraft, TF-AAK, with partial ATC from the aircraft's clearance (with Bruce Dickinson speaking!), taxiing, and taking off from runway 30 at YEG.

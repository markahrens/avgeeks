 "name": "Air China Cargo 777-FFT [B-2096] Landing and Takeoff at Edmonton Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Back in September 2015, Air China Cargo opened up a new route from Shanghai to Edmonton to Dallas-Fort Worth (and back again) 3 times a week with a Boeing 777 Freighter. I've already caught this bird landing but never got a good shot of the takeoff. Well, without further ado, here is B-2096 landing on runway 30 and taking off 2 hours later with some incredible engine sound. ATC is included on takeoff, enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air China Cargo (CAO/CA)\nAircraft: Boeing 777 Freighter (B77F)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE90-110B1L\nRegistration: B-2096\nRoute: PVG-YEG-DFW\nCallsign: Air China Freight 1075 heavy\nRunway used: 30/02\nLocal Time: 0900/1100\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/B2096\n____________________________________________________\n\nPrevious video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFGy1BJfrt0\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nGoogle Plus: https://www.google.com/+dude8472productions\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

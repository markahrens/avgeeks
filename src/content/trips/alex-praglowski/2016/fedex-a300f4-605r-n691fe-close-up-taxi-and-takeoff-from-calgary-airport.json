 "name": "FedEx A300F4-605R [N691FE] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "FedEx is one of the largest remaining operators of the Airbus A300, and Calgary is served every weekday with one such aircraft to and from the carrier's hub in Memphis. Here we have FX135 taxiing up close on Bravo and departing runway 17L a couple months ago, with some great lighting. Enjoy this classic bird (which is actually not so classic, being just under 10 years old).\n\nThanks for watching!\n____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: FedEx Express (FDX/FX)\nAircraft: Airbus A300F4-600R (A306)\nAircraft Name: \"Hanna\"\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2A5F \nRegistration: N691FE \nRoute: YYC-MEM\nCallsign: FedEx 135\nRunway used: 17L\nLocal Time: 2000\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N691FE\n____________________________________________________\n\nPrevious video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yZsMsT7v8Q\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

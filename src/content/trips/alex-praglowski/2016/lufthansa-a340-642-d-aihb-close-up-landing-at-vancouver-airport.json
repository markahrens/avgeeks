 "name": "Lufthansa A340-642 [D-AIHB] Close Up Landing at Vancouver Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "The A340 is one of the most unique and majestic airliners in the sky today, and the -600 series is no exception. Thankfully, Lufthansa remains committed to keeping this aircraft in service for the next several years, and thankfully, I was able to catch it arriving at YVR from Munich! Here we have D-AIHB touching down on runway 08L, from one of my absolute favorite spotting locations. ATC is included, along with some from a company 747 departing for Frankfurt. You can see it in the background as the nose gear touches down. Enjoy this special A340 catch!\n\nThanks for watching!\n____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Lufthansa (DLH/LH)\nAircraft: Airbus A340-600 (A346)\nAircraft Name: Bremerhaven\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x RR Trent 500\nRegistration: D-AIHB\nRoute: MUC-YVR\nCallsign: Lufthansa 476 heavy\nRunway used: 08L\nLocal Time: 1700\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAIHB\n____________________________________________________\n\nPrevious video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS2v7oU0Sb8\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nGoogle Plus: https://www.google.com/+dude8472productions\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

 "name": "A Windy Evening of Plane Spotting at Calgary International Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "On April 2nd, spotters at YYC were treated to some rare crosswind runway operations thanks to a Chinook. As a result, most narrowbody aircraft (And a BA 787) used the crosswind runway 11-29. With 20-30 knot winds right out of the west, it was a challenge for pilots (and me!), making for some exciting footage, especially that United Embraer at 6:53. This compilation features several landings and takeoffs on runway 29, and finishes off with an Air Canada 777 landing on runway 35R. Sit back, relax, and enjoy 11 minutes of windy plane spotting action at Calgary Airport!\n\nThanks for watching!\n____________________________________________________\n\nPrevious video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-j_3Yh65t4\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nGoogle Plus: https://www.google.com/+dude8472productions\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

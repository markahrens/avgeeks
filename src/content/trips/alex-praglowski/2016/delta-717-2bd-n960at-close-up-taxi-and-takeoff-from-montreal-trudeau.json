 "description": "Believe it or not, this is actually my first time seeing a 717. Here we have one of many former AirTran 717 (or MD-95) aircraft taxiing up close on Alpha and taking off runway 24L at Montréal Pierre Elliot Trudeau International Airport. I've got lots of footage coming up from YUL, so stay tuned for that! Enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nShoutout to CYUL Plane Spotter for showing me around.

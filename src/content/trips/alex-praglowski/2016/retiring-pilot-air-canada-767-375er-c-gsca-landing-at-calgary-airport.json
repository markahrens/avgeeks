 "description": "Follow me on Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude847...\n\nAC10 from Tokyo-Narita to Calgary International Airport today was the final flight of an Air Canada pilot before his retirement. C-GSCA is seen here touching down on 35L, with some kudos from the tower and ground controllers. A water salute was rumored, but the temperature was just above freezing so I assume they called it off. Enjoy this quick upload.\n\nThanks for watching!\n____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-300ER (B763)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B6F \nRegistration: C-GSCA\nRoute: NRT-YYC\nCallsign: HULL010 heavy\nRunway used: 35L\nLocal Time: 1015\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGSCA\n____________________________________________________\n\nPrevious video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAmDs...\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude847...\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472pro...\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472produ...\nGoogle Plus: https://www.google.com/+dude8472produ...\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_...\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

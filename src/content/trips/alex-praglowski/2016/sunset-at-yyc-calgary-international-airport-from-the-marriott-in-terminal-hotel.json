 "description": "Something different from me today! Here's a time lapse of the sunset at YYC Calgary International Airport on a cloudy day in October, from the 7th floor of the brand new Marriott in-terminal hotel. The footage was captured over two hours and includes, if you can spot it, a BA 789 and a WestJet 767, along with the usual myriad of Air Canada Jazz and WestJet aircraft.

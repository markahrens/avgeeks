 "name": "INAUGURAL FLIGHT - Hainan Airlines A330-243 [B-6116] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "June 30th, 2016 is an important day for the City of Calgary, with the start of regular airline service to Beijing, China. Hainan Airlines will serve the two cities three times a week with the A330-200 until the end of July, where it will be replaced by a 787-8. A fourth weekly flight will be added starting in October. Here we have B-6116, a fairly young A330-200 operating the inaugural flight today, landing on 17R and departing 3 hours later (with a slight delay due to weather) on 35L. ATC is featured throughout, including a nice welcome from the tower controller.

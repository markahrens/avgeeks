 "description": "Filmed back in 2015, Air Canada's first 787 is seen here touching down on runway 08L at Vancouver Airport after a 9 hour flight from Tokyo Narita. This was the second to last flight of the unforgettable Air Canada Foundation trip, on the plane that started it all! I will not be uploading the takeoff footage from Narita as the sun had already set. I still have a couple videos from Japan coming, so stay tuned for those. Enjoy this on-board footage!\n\nThanks for watching!\n____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (B788)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B\nSeat: 33A\nArrival Time: 1200L\nRegistration: C-GHPQ \nRoute: NRT-YVR\nCallsign: Air Canada 004 Heavy\nRunway used: 08L\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGHPV\n____________________________________________________\n\nPrevious video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7uYjezp-gU\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

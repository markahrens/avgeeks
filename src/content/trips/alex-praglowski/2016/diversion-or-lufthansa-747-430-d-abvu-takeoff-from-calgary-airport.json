 "description": "Look at that condensation! Here we have an 18-year old Lufthansa 747-400 departing Calgary International Airport after a medical diversion en route from Frankfurt to Seattle as LH490. Sure was a nice treat to see this beauty, and with some amazing condensation as well, you don't see that very often in Calgary. Hopefully the passenger makes a speedy recovery. Enjoy this special catch.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Lufthansa (DLH/LH)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-400 (B744)\nAircraft Name: \"Bayern\"\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x GE CF6-80C2B1F \nRegistration: D-ABVU\nRoute: FRA-(YYC)-SEA\nCallsign: Lufthansa 490 heavy\nRunway used: 17R\nLocal Time: 1300\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/DABVU\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

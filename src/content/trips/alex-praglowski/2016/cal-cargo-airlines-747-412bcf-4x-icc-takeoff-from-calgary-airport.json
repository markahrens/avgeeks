 "description": "The rare visitors just keep coming! Here we have one of three 747s from Israeli cargo carrier CAL Cargo Airlines departing YYC after a week long stay on our cargo apron. This bird was in town to transport the horses for the Spruce Meadows Masters event, an annual event that takes place south of Calgary, a horse jumping show with professionals from all over the world. The past couple of years, National Air Cargo has flown the horses in, but a new carrier is always welcome, though not as pretty a sight as National's 747s.

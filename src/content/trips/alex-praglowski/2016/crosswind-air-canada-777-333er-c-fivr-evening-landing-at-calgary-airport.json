 "name": "Crosswind! Air Canada 777-333ER [C-FIVR] Evening Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Golden hour! This Air Canada 777-300ER paid a visit to YYC from Toronto this evening, with some heavy winds right out of the west. Even though the crosswind runway was in use for the regular aircraft, Calgary Arrival still sent him to 35R. Either way, it made for a spectacular (and well done) crosswind landing in some perfect evening lighting. Sorry about the shakiness, there's not much you can do when you're standing on top of a hill in 20-30 knot winds. ATC is included, and I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-300ER (B77W)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE90-115B\nRegistration: C-FIVR\nRoute: YYZ-YYC\nCallsign: Air Canada 125 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nLocal Time: 1900\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFIVR\n____________________________________________________\n\nPrevious video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNbMSi3Us0M\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nGoogle Plus: https://www.google.com/+dude8472productions\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

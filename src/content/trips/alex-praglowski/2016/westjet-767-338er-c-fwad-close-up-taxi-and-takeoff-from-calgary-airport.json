 "description": "WestJet's 767 services to London have not gotten off to the best start, with lots of delays due to a number of maintenance issues. Omni Air International subbed a couple of flights recently, and the performance seems to have improved as of late. Anyway, here's fin 672 operating Calgary to Gatwick (on time, for once) taxiing up close and departing runway 35R. ATC is included.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: WestJet (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-300ER (B76W)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Revised\nEngines: 2x GE CF6-80C2B6 \nRegistration: C-FWAD\nRoute: YYC-LGW\nCallsign: WestJet 1 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nLocal Time: 1900\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFWAD\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

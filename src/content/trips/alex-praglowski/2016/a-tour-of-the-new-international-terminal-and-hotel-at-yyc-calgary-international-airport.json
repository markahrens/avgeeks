 "description": "On October 31st, 2016, Calgary International Airport officially opened its multi-million dollar terminal expansion, intended to serve transborder and international destinations from Calgary. The expansion, which includes 28 new aircraft gates, will no doubt serve the city extremely well for decades to come. Along with the expansion, a new, in-terminal Marriott hotel opened, which has 7 floors and an incredible view of the airport as well as the city of Calgary. Enjoy this montage of clips from both locations, and congratulations to my home airport on this huge achievement!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",

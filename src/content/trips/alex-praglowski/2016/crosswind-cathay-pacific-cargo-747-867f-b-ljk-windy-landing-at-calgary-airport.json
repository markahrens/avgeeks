 "description": "Cathay Pacific Cargo made a very late appearance at Calgary International Airport today. The flights are typically operated from 1-5AM, but this bird showed up at 1:55PM, a very welcome sight for the spotters. In addition to that, the pilots had a crosswind of 14 to 19 knots, making for a spectacular touchdown. ATC is included, enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

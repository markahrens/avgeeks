 "name": "Lufthansa CityLine CRJ-701ER [D-ACPP] Onboard Takeoff from Frankfurt ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Hey everyone, this is the final leg of my trip, onboard a Lufthansa CityLine CRJ-700. Nothing too exciting about the takeoff itself, aside from the engine sound, but during the taxi, there's lots of cool aircraft. Namely, the Lufthansa A321 Retrojet, and the Lufthansa A380 that takes off right before us! That A380 just happened to be D-AIMG, the one I flew in on 3 hours earlier from Houston! I hope you guys enjoy the video, and watch in 1080p!\n \nThanks for watching!

 "name": "Atlas Air 747-4U7F [N408MC] Landing and Close Up Taxi in Calgary ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "What a massive aircraft! This was quite a nice surprise to get an Atlas Air 747 in daylight, since these usually come at night. Unfortunately, C-FRAM, operating as AC844 to Frankfurt, decided to photobomb the approach shot. As you will see in the video, right after landing, I moved to an area near the cargo buildings to see it taxi extremely close up. I have never seen an aircraft that large taxi that close to me. I couldn`t fit the whole plane in the frame, it was that close. So, I hope you guys enjoy the video as much as I did filming it!\n\nThanks for watching!

 "name": "A Tribute to San Diego International Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Here is my final video from my trip to San Diego back in February, with the exception of my upcoming onboard videos from the trip home. SAN is truly a one of a kind airport to spot at, and even though there aren't many heavies, the viewpoints are stellar. The lighting you can get during the evening is incredible as well. Hopefully I'll return someday and get some more of the cargo heavies. I hope you enjoy this music video!\n\nThanks for watching!

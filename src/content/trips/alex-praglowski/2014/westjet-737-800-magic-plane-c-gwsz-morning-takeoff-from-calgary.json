 "description": "I told you I would catch this beauty again! ;) Here we have Mickeyjet, as she is affectionately known by YYC spotters, making a morning takeoff on Calgary International Airport's runway 35L bound for warmer weather (specifically San Diego). Apologies for not including the rotation, my camera's autofocus messed up so I decided to edit that part out. I hope you still enjoy :)\n\nThanks for watching!

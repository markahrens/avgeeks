 "description": "Hey everybody, here's Norwegian Long Haul's 2nd 787 doing a rejected takeoff at Paine Field. I saw -LNB a lot during my last few days at Paine, so I got lots of footage of her. The tail has since been painted, and she's now flying with Norwegian. Sadly, I only have a few Paine Field videos left :( Hope you guys enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

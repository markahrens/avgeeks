 "name": "LOT Polish Airlines 787-8 [SP-LRF] Afternoon Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "What a nice surprise! Today, 2 LOT 787s came in to YYC, SP-LRF and SP-LRD, operating more charters for the RAF, along with an Atlas Air 747-400F. I missed the landing of all 3 of those, and, to my knowledge, SP-LRD and the 747-400F haven't departed yet. Sorry for the non-ideal viewpoint, he switched runways at the last minute (I was hoping to get a close up taxi shot, like with my Air Canada 777-200LR) and sent us spotters all over the place. Hope you enjoy, nonetheless!\n\nThanks for watching!

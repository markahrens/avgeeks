 "name": "Air Canada 777-233LR Takeoff From Calgary ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Here's an Air Canada 777-200LR departing Calgary for Toronto, upgraded from the usual A319 due to cancelled flights. Normally when Air Canada does this, they use the 777-300ER, and even that's pretty rare, so the -200LRs are almost never seen here.\n\nI would also like to dedicate this video to someone who helped me catch this bird... YUL PLANE SPOTTER! He's an awesome spotter at Montreal who let me know that this guy was coming to YYC. So, thanks a lot buddy, this one's for you :)\n\nCheck out his awesome channel here: https://www.youtube.com/CYULPlaneSpotter\n\nThanks for watching!

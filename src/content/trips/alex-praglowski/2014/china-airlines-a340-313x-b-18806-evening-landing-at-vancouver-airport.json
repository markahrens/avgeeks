 "description": "Believe it or not, this is actually my first spotting video of an Airbus A340 on this channel. Here is China Airlines' 5x weekly flight landing at Vancouver International Airport, with ATC communications included. I apologize for the shakiness and the off-focus at the end, but as I mentioned before, it's my first A340 spotting video so I had to upload it!\n\nThanks for watching!

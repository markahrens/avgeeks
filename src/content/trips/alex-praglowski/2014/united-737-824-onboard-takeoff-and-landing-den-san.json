 "description": "Hey everyone, here's a new travel video, featuring the second leg of my trip to San Diego, from Denver. You can't see much anyway, so I figured I would upload both flights as one video. Sorry for the lousy focus on landing. You can see my favorite spotting location at 2:32, the Aladdin Parking Garage :) Hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

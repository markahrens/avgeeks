 "description": "I'd like to specially dedicate this video to the Calgary Airport Authority, for putting on such an incredible event yesterday, and also to Air Canada, for allowing me the privilege of going on board their 787. This music video features some footage of the 787 taxiing, an exterior and interior walkaround, and then some footage from the first touch and go that the 787 did at Calgary International Airport.\n\nAfter all this, I can only say that C-GHPQ will always have a special place in my heart :)\n\nThanks for watching!

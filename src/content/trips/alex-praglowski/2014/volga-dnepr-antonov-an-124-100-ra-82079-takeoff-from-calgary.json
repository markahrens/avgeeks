 "name": "Volga-Dnepr Antonov An-124-100 [RA-82079] Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Here she is, the mighty An-124 departing Calgary International Airport for Gander. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't take the normal taxi route that planes going to 35R usually do, which is to go over that taxiway bridge (like in my KLM 77W video). It must have been too heavy for the bridge, or the wingspan was too wide. Either way, I hope you'll still enjoy the video, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

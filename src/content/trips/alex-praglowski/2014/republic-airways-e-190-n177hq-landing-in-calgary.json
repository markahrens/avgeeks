 "description": "This was a pleasant surprise to the spotters waiting for Air Canada's 777 inaugural flight from Frankfurt. I saw it coming on FlightRadar24, and the picture shown had it in the Frontier livery, so I was kind of disappointed when I found out it wasn't :( But any E-190 that's not Air Canada is definitely worth filming, lol. I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

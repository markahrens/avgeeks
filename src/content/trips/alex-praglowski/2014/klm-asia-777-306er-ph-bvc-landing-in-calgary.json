 "description": "Holy mother of equipment changes! :o\nHere we have one of the largest aircraft in the KLM fleet, the mighty Boeing 777-300ER arriving from Amsterdam. This was quite an event, since KLM almost never swaps aircraft! Sorry about not getting the touchdown... I was positioned in the right spot to get the touchdown after the plane passed that building, but he touched down early :/ Interestingly the flight today was supposed to be the smaller 777-200ER, but maybe had a mechanical issue, so KLM sent the -300ER since it's fairly similar to the 200 and wouldn't be too confusing for ground crew. Of course, I would much rather see their MD-11, but this will do ;D Hope you guys enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

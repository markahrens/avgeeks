 "description": "Hey everyone, here's another video from Krakow, featuring a Norwegian Air Shuttle Boeing 737-800 landing and taking off from Krakow's John Paul II International Airport. I've only ever seen Norwegian's 787s but not their 737-800s, so this was a nice surprise. Hope you enjoy, and sorry for the shakiness, and for the rain on the windows during the departure. \n\nI've also launched a brand new channel website!

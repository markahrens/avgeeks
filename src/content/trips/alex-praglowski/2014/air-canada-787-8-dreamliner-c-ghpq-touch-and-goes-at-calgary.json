 "name": "Air Canada 787-8 Dreamliner [C-GHPQ] Touch and Goes at Calgary ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "More history in the making for Calgary International Airport! This video features the second and third touch and goes that Air Canada's first 787 Dreamliner did at Calgary International Airport prior to the Roam the Runway event on Sunday, June 15th. IMO, the 3rd touch and go (2nd one in this video) is one of the best rotation shots I have ever captured. Hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p for HD 787 action! \n\nThanks for watching!

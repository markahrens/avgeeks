 "description": "Not exactly my best production... My tripod fluid froze up, so I wasn't able to get the overhead perfectly. I still wanted to upload this though, since this bird has the new Split Scimitar Winglets, and it was my first time seeing them. They look pretty sharp, IMO :)\n\nThanks for watching!

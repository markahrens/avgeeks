 "description": "This was such an awesome surprise! I got to the airport at 5AM for the start of my trip back home, checked in my bags, looked at the departure/arrival screen and saw this bird coming in! Now, the arrival screen didn't give me a lot of information, and I didn't know much about the airline, or what type of aircraft it might possibly be. After checking FlightRadar24 using the airport's free WiFi, I discovered that it was an MD-80! Needless to say, I went up to the observation deck right away and waited for it to come. In the foreground, you'll see my Lufthansa CityLine CRJ-700 being prepped for departure. Now, in my excitement, and forgetting how my camera is in low-light conditions, I forgot to set my manual focus. At least the touchdown is somewhat in focus, but the rest isn't great. I also apologize for any shakiness. However, the taxi shot and the sound is pretty darn awesome, if I do say so myself ;) I hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

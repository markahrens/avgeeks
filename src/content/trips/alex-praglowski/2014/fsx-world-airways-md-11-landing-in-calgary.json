 "description": "Hey everybody, here's a new FSX video, featuring a World Airways MD-11 landing at Calgary International Airport. This is sort of a re-creation of my video back in late 2013 of this very aircraft, including the actual amazing sound from the video too. I also \"FSX-ified\" my intro too, also with the original sound. Hope you enjoy, and leave a request for another one of my videos that you want me to \"FSX-ify\" if you want :)\n\nThanks for watching!

 "description": "WARNING! Loud engine noise after the intro!\n\nHere we have a Federal Express McDonnell Douglas MD-10-10F landing and taking off at San Diego International Airport. Sorry for the lack of approach footage, I was packing up my tripod after British Airways landed and didn't see this guy until he was on short final. The takeoff is filmed from my hotel. Hope you enjoy, and don't forget to watch in 1080p for best quality!\n\nThanks for watching!

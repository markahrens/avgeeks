 "description": "Woohoo, finally caught this bird again... Sort of. Right as he lined up on the runway, my camera battery died. I took over right away with my iPhone though, so at least you get the takeoff, plus the close-up shots of the taxi that I was able to get with my camera. Hope you enjoy, nonetheless!\n\nThanks for watching!

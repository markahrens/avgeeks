 "description": "Finally caught Cargojet again! Haven't seen 'em in... Oh, 6 months :P Anyway, I was out spotting one night when it was really foggy and couldn't see any landings, so I decided to go here and see Cargojet's 767-200 taxiing into the stand and shutting down its engines. It was also really cold, about -15 and snowing really hard, so I hope you guys enjoy ;)\n\nAlso, I've been considering getting a new video editor. Are there any you would recommend? :)\n\nThanks for watching!

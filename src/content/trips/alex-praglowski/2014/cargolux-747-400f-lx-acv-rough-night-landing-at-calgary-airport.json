 "description": "Hey guys, here's my very first video edited with CyberLink PowerDirector! :D Here we have one of Cargolux rare GE CF6-powered 744s (Usually they're RB211s) It was kind of cool seeing this bird which, strangely, has no titles at all with the exception of the Cargolux logo on the tail and winglets. Video is best viewed in a dark room with the lights off :) Hope you guys enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

 "name": "British Airways 767-336ER [G-BNWV] Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "EDIT: After 8 months of on-and-off 787 service, the 767 has returned for the summer season, and the 787 will be back on October 26th. This clip was the last flight before the 787 came for a few months.\n\nFor the last 8 years that British Airways has flown to Calgary, 6 of those have been flown by the trusty 767-300ER. September 15th marks the final day that a British Airways Boeing 767 will fly their LHR-YYC flight, operating as BA103/102. Tomorrow, September 16th, the flight will be operated by a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. And I plan to catch it.\n\nAn even sadder sight in the background is YYC's old control tower being dismantled :(\n\nI realize this isn't my best video. I didn't hear the flight crew's initial communication to Calgary Approach on my scanner stating what runway they were going to use, so I was only able to figure out what runway once they were lined up on the approach, and this was the only spot I could reach in time. I hope you enjoy, nonetheless!\n\nThanks for watching!

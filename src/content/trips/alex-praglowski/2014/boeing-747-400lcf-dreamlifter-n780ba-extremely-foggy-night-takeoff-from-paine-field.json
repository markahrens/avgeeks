 "name": "Boeing 747-400LCF Dreamlifter [N780BA] Extremely Foggy Night Takeoff from Paine Field ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "So... I saw this guy on flightaware... And I got out of my cozy hotel bed at 3AM... And everything was going well... Then the fog came. Sigh.\n\nAnyway, this is a little bonus video for you guys (Yes, I know I said in my last dreamlifter video that it was the last one, but I wasn't sure on whether to upload this or not). It's not possible to see the takeoff at all in the video, but I included what footage I had, and also tweaked the video to be able to see as much as possible.\n\nThanks for watching!

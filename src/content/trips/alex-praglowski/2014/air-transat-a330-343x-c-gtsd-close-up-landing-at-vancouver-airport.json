 "description": "Another YVR video, this one featuring one of Air Transat's 4 A330-300s. In Calgary we only see their A330-200s, although there have been some equipment swaps lately (haven't caught any of them though), so this was pretty nice to see! I hope you enjoy this quick video.\n\nThanks for watching!

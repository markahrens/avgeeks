 "name": "French Air Force A310-304 [F-RADA] Snowy Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "First time catching a French-registered plane in Calgary! Here is a French Air Force A310-300 landing and taxiing close up at Calgary International Airport during some heavy snow. Apparently the president of France is making a 2-day visit to Canada, and one of the stops is Banff, a town 100 km west of Calgary. Banff doesn't have an airport capable of handling large aircraft such as this, so they'll land at the nearest airport (YYC) and drive to Banff. This plane was supposedly carrying media and other people to prepare for his arrival tomorrow (November 2nd), and I hope to get it. As you can see in the video, not the most favorable conditions for spotting, so I apologize for any shakiness. Please watch in HD, since the aircraft isn't very visible at the beginning of the video and it might look a bit blurry. Check out the video of this very aircraft departing Montreal as well, link is below. I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nRead more about Francois Hollande's visit to Canada here: http://www.rmoutlook.com/article/20141030/RMO0801/310309998/french-president-to-visit-banff\n\nThanks for watching!

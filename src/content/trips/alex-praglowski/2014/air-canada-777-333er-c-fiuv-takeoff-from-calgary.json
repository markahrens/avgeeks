 "description": "Whenever an A380 comes, LAX spotters will usually say \"The champ is here!\", although some 747 fans may disagree ;) This is YYC's \"champ\", smaller than the A380, but just as impressive. Just listen to those GE-90s! For my next 777 video I'm gonna try to get closer and get the spool-up sound :) I hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

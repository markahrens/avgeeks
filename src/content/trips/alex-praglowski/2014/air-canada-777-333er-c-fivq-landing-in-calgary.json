 "description": "Yippee, another 777 video. Sorry, but I can not get enough of these beasts, after being 777-deprived last summer (looking at you, Air Canada) :P Anyway, here is fin #740, C-FIVQ landing on runway 17R arriving from FRA. I attempted to catch the inaugural flight of the 77W on the LHR-YYC route today, but I didn't make it in time, plus it was raining pretty hard :/\n\nThanks for watching!

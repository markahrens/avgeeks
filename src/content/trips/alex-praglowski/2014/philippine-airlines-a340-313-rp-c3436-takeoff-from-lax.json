 "description": "First of all, I want to thank you for all the comments on my previous video. I always appreciate the support :) Second of all, I know I said I was done with my LAX videos, but I found this clip and I thought I should upload it, since there's only one other A340 video on my channel (at the time of uploading). Third of all, let me ask you this - Do you (my viewers) want a \"Best Engine Sounds of 2014\" video? Let me know in the comments, and I hope you enjoy this quick video.\n\nThanks for watching!

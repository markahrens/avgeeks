 "description": "Parallel runways... Ugh. I was all set up at 35R, thinking that, since this bird was coming from the east, he would land on the east runway. Nope. He landed on the existing runway, for a shorter taxi time. All I can say is that I really need to use my scanner more often. At least I got a good close-up shot of it parked, and hopefully I can get the takeoff.\n\nAnyway, here is a Sheikh from Abu Dhabi arriving in Calgary, after a 15 hour flight from the Middle East. This is probably the only time I will ever see a plane from the UAE in Calgary, given the relationship the Canadian government has with the Emirates :P In the close-up shots after the landing, it almost looks like the slats are literally made of gold... Hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

 "name": "Lufthansa Airbus A380-841 [D-AIMG] Dawn Landing in Frankfurt ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Here is my very first flight on the Superjumbo arriving in Frankfurt, after a very pleasant 10 hour flight from Houston. The service onboard was outstanding, surprisingly so for economy class, and I would definitely fly Lufthansa again. On short final, I included a picture in picture view of the tail camera on my inflight entertainment screen, which was a very cool feature of the A380 that I enjoyed very much. I hope you'll enjoy the video, and stay tuned for a lot more to come!\n\nThanks for watching!

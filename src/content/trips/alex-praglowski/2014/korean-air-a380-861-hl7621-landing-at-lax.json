 "description": "Hello everyone, this is my 380th upload on YouTube, and what better way to celebrate 380 videos than with a video of an A380? ;D Here is the 3rd, and last A380 that I caught on my trip to LAX. I still have a bit more footage, but the LAX videos are going to be over soon, but there'll still be some SAN footage coming. I hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

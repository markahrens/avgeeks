 "name": "British Airways 767-336ER [G-BNWY] Overhead Landing in Calgary ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Yay, Speedbird! It's been a while since I've seen BA here in YYC, but it's been even longer since I've spotted an overhead landing in Calgary too, mostly because my favorite spot for overheads was covered in a 5 foot snowdrift for most of the winter :P But I found a different one, although there's a conveniently located hill right behind it, as you'll see in the video, lol. I hope you enjoy, and sorry for the shakiness!\n\nThanks for watching!

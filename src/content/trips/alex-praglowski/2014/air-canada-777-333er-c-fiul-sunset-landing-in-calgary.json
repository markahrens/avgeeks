 "description": "Well this was quite a sight! I'm glad I managed to catch this beauty, thanks to the help of CYUL Plane Spotter once again ;) YYC never sees 777s in the winter, except to clear backlogs of passengers if there's been a lot of cancellations. Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy this sunset footage :)\n\nThanks for watching!

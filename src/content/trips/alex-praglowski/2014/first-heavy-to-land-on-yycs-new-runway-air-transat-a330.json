 "name": "First Heavy to land on YYC's New Runway - Air Transat A330 ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "After the two largest airlines at Calgary International Airport made the first landings on YYC's new runway, it seems fitting that onew of the largest carriers at YYC would perform the first landing ever performed by a wide-body aircraft on that runway. Once again I'm sorry for all the shakiness and wind noise, I was up on top of a very large hill and I was fairly susceptible to wind up there. I hope you'll enjoy, nonetheless. Please keep in mind that access to this spot was opened up only temporarily for the first operations on the new runway, and it's now impossible to reach, since it's right in the middle of a large construction site. Once all the construction clears up, I'll be able to shoot from here again, hopefully.\n\nThanks for watching!

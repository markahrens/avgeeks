 "description": "Here is my first plane spotting video from Vancouver International Airport, featuring a Sichuan Airlines A330 touching down on Runway 08L after a 9 hour flight from Shenyang, China. This was a completely new airline for me, so it was pretty cool to see. As you can see, I found delpillar's favorite location ;) I hope you enjoy, and stay tuned for a lot more footage to come!\n\nThanks for watching!

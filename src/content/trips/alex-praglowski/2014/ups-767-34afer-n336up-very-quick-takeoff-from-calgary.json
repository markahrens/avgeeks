 "description": "YEEEESSSSS!!! I finally caught one of UPS' 767s! And with winglets, no less! Here is UPS flight 491 making a very quick takeoff from Calgary International Airport's Runway 17R. Not only did it take him less than 5,000 feet to rotate, he also turned onto the runway very quickly. I hope you guys enjoy, and stay tuned for my final spotting compilation from Poland tomorrow.\n\nThanks for watching!

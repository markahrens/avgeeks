 "name": "Condor 767-330ER [D-ABUH] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Love that lighting! Here is one of Condor's last flights into Calgary for the season, taxiing very close up and taking off from Runway 35R. This was taken he same day that the Air Canada 777-200LR close up taxi/takeoff video was shot, so during some pretty heavy winds right before a snowstorm. I will definitely try to get some more of these types of videos over the winter, seeing as they're pretty popular on my channel (300-400+ views). So, without further ado, I hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!

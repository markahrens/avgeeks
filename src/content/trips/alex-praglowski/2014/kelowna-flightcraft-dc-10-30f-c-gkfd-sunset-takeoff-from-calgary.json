 "description": "Here we have one of Kelowna Flightcraft's DC-10-30Fs pushing back, checking flight controls, taxiing, and departing Calgary International Airport for Vancouver, in some gorgeous evening light. Just listen to the spool-up sound, didn't know those CF-6s could buzz like that! IMO, this is probably my best video of KF's DC-10 yet :) Hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nI really need to get on the ball about catching these DC-10s before they're gone in April 2015. It's been 4 months since my last DC-10 video, and I have no excuse for that. Shame on you, dude8472productions! :P \n\nThanks for watching!

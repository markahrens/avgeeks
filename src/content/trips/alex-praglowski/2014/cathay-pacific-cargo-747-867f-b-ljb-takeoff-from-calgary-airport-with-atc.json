 "description": "Hey everyone, here is the first departure of Cathay Pacific Cargo's new 747-8F service to YYC, taking up a lot of Runway 35L/17R to get to Hong Kong. I apologize for the shakiness and bad camera work, it was quite windy and I wasn't in the most ideal location. On the plus side, I managed to get the ATC communications recorded. Please watch the landing video if you haven't already, it's much better than this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4FxX0ZKkNA \n\nI hope you enjoy somewhat.\n\nThanks for watching!

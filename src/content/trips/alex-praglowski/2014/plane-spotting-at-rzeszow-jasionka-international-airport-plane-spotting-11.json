 "description": "Hey everyone, here is my second to last spotting video from Poland, featuring 9 minutes of action at Rzeszow-Jasionka International Airport. As you can see, I only got videos of 3 planes, but I tried to make them as comprehensive as I could. \n\nSo anyway, the Embraer 195 was a cool catch for me, since I only see the 190s back at home, and the Q400 was, well, the only time I've ever been excited to see a Q400, because A) RZE doesn't have a lot of action, so it's great to a plane actually moving, and B) It's in a special livery.\n\nI hope you guys enjoy, and sorry for any shakiness, this was all shot freehand.\n\nThanks for watching!

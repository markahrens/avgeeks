 "description": "Hey everyone, here we have my first spotting video from my vacation, at Krakow-Balice International Airport! I was pleasantly surprised to see this bird waiting to take off as soon as I got to this spot, since I've never seen LOT's 737-400 before. Plus, 734s are pretty rare to see in scheduled service nowadays, so that was an added bonus. Sorry for all the shakiness, I couldn't bring my tripod (for obvious reasons). I did gain a fair bit of freehand filming experience, however. Hope you enjoy, and don't forget to vote for my next video!\n\nThanks for watching!

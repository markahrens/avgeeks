 "description": "Well, this is a pretty rare catch to finish off 2014! Here is my very first catch of a Russian built aircraft (Antonovs are technically Ukrainian), an Ilyushin Il-76TD-90VD belonging to Volga Dnepr making a fuel stop at Calgary Airport. \"Vladimir Kokkinaki\" arrived from New Iberia, Louisiana, carrying some survey equipment on its way to Singapore. Reportedly, this equipment will be used to help search for MH370. ATC is included throughout as well, with captions! Enjoy the video :)\n\nThanks for watching!

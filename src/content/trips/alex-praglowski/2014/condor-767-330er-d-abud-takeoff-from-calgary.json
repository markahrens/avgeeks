 "description": "Yay, Condor! :D I'm glad they're back again for this summer. I just love seeing their 767s with those gigantic winglets! Anyway, here is D-ABUD taking off from Calgary's new runway. Same spot as my previous videos, but you can still get a pretty nice view of 17L takeoffs! Hope you enjoy, and stay tuned for another video from the temporary spot that I went to for the first operations tomorrow!\n\nThanks for watching!

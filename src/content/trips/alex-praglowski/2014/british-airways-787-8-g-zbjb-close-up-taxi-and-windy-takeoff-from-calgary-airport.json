 "name": "British Airways 787-8 [G-ZBJB] Close Up Taxi and Windy Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "This is a pretty rare sight, British Airways' second 787 taking off from one of YYC's two crosswind runways. It takes a lot of crosswind to get ATC off of using the parallels (around 36+ knots or so), and I can testify just how darn windy it was, lol. This is probably the most use 29 and 26 have seen since the new runway opened.\n\nI'm pretty happy with this footage, surprisingly little wind noise and shakiness, though there is some. Love that close up view too. So anyway, I hope you enjoy, sorry for any wind noise and camera shakes (for obvious reasons) and stay tuned for more.\n\nThanks for watching!

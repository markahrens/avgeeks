 "name": "Air Canada 787-8 [C-GHPV] Dusk Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "What a nice surprise! Here we have Air Canada`s 4th Dreamliner arriving from Toronto as an equipment change carrying some passengers from a previously cancelled YYZ-YYC flight. Even though we get a 787 from British Airways daily, it`s always nice to see an AC bird. I apologize for the bad camera work on the landing clip, I got to the top of the parkade literally in the nick of time, he was about 30 seconds away from touchdown as I parked so I had very little time to set my tripod up appropriately. They parked at one of the best gates for me to see it parked though, which was a plus. I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

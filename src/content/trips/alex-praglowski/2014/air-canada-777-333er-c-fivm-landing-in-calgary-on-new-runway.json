 "description": "The first Boeing 777 to land on Calgary International Airport's newest runway! Here is my final video that I took from the temporary spot that the Calgary Airport Authority made for spotters to get the first takeoffs and landings on the new runway. Just such an awesome view! Hope you enjoy, and sorry for all the shakiness and wind noise :/\n\nI've also updated my YYC spotting guide with 2 locations for the new runway, link is below.\n\nThanks for watching!

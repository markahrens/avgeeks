 "description": "Whoa. So that's what a 777-300ER looks like from here ;) Seriously though, this plane is GIGANTIC! I was zoomed out all the way and still couldn't fit the entire plane in the frame, as you'll see in the video. Such an impressive sight! Sorry for all the shakiness on the takeoff, the wind decided to pick up :/ It was just awesome to see one of KLM's 77Ws here, hopefully we get another equipment change sometime! I hope you guys enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

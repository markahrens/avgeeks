 "description": "Hey everyone, in this video we have a Cargolux 747-400F departing Calgary International Airport, bound for Luxembourg. I also tried out a different spot, which has super close up views of aircraft and amazing spool-up sounds, as shown in the video. Listening to those RB211s roaring gives me goosebumps :) Hope you all enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

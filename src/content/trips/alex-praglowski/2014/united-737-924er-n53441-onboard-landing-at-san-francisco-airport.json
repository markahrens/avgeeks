 "name": "United 737-924ER [N53441] Onboard Landing at San Francisco Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Here we have my first time landing at San Francisco International Airport on Runway 28L, coincidentally the same one Asiana 214 crashed on. You can still see markings on the ground from where the wreckage was. Pretty eerie. \n\nCheck out all the condensation on the approach, and I hope you enjoy the video. Sorry for the lack of uploads recently, I've been pretty busy. Hoping to have another video up on Sunday. \n\nThanks for watching!

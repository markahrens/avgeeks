 "description": "Wow. I do have to say that this may be my best video yet. Everything turned out incredible in this clip, from the sunlight to the condensation to the spray...\n\nThis, unfortunately, is my very last spotting video from Paine Field. I do have a short music video and a compilation coming up, but this will be the last takeoff/landing clip from this trip. Fear not my fellow spotters, I will definitely go back someday :)\n\nAnyway, I hope you guys enjoy this video as much as I do :)\n\nThanks for watching!

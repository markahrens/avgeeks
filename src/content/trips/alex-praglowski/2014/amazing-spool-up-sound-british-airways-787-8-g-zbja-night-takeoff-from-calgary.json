 "description": "Turn your speakers up all the way! I must say, I do miss the BA 767s a bit less now! Here is British Airways' first 787 departing Calgary on its flight back to London-Heathrow, with a phenomenal spool up sound! I am also very impressed with my new camera, this was the first night video I filmed with it and it turned out very well! I hope you guys enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!

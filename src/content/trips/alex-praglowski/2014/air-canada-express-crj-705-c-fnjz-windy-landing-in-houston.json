 "name": "Air Canada Express CRJ-705 [C-FNJZ] Windy Landing in Houston ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "What a windy approach! Here we have my CRJ-705 landing at Houston George Buch Intercontinental Airport, on runway 25L. As the aircraft touched down, I was immediately greeted by a Lufthansa Cargo 777F, as you'll see in the video, and in a few more shots. While taxiing in, I also saw a newly painted Delta 717, which was quite a treat as well! Hope you guys enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

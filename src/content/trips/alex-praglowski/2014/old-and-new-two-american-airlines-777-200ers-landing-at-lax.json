 "name": "Old and New - Two American Airlines 777-200ERs Landing at LAX ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Hey everyone, here`s another LAX video shot from Imperial Hill, featuring two American Airlines 777s landing one after the other on Runway 25L. Unfortunately, the touchdowns were blocked by a parked Kalitta Air 747-200 that apparently never moves. \n\nAnyone that is affected by the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 has my complete sympathy. R.I.P. to all those that perished.\n\nThanks for watching.

 "description": "You guys tired of 777 videos yet? ;)\n\nHere we have C-FITW departing Calgary International Airport for Frankfurt. This bird was the same one that operated the inaugural 777 flight back in March. As I said in my last 777 video, I tried to get closer to the plane and catch the spool-up, and I sort of accomplished that... In between wind noise and other planes :P I will definitely try to get the whole GE-90 spool-up in the time that the 77W is here though. I hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

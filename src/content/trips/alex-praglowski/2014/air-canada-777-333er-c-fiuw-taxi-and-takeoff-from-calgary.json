 "description": "Dat sound... Dat wing flex... Dat rotation... Man, I'm so glad Air Canada brought these beauties back to YYC :D This is Air Canada 844 Heavy departing YYC for Frankfurt, on its 3rd flight being operated by the 777. I filmed this same aircraft a few days ago when it was making up for some cancelled flights to Toronto, but thankfully the weather conditions were better for this time ;) I hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p for better quality!\n\nThanks for watching!

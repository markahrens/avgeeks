 "description": "Hey guys! \nSo, while I was on vacation, I realized that the only way I was going to improve my channel and my videos further was to invest in some new equipment. Specifically, a new camera. So, I bought the same camera that I returned a month ago, and after doing a few test videos and making sure I'm using the correct settings, I'm quite impressed with it. When you compare some of my older footage with this one. the difference in quality is fairly noticeable. It also gives me the ability to use an external microphone, plus a 120fps slow motion mode!\n\nAnyway, without further ado, I bring you this video of a KLM A330 landing, an Air Canada 767 taking off, and a Westjet 737 with split scimitars landing. I hope you'll enjoy the different method of filming too :)\n\nThanks for watching!

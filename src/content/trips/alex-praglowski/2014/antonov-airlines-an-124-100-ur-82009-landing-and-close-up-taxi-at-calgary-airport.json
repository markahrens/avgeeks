 "description": "Wow, now this was an impressive sight! Here is one of Antonov Design Bureau's 7 An-124s arriving and taxiing extremely close up after a whopping 12 hour flight from Kiev Gostomel Airport. Pretty cool to see ADB's new livery as well, and those 787-style chevrons on the engines are interesting as well. As you'll see in the video, the #3 thrust reverser is also stuck. So, I hope you enjoy and watch in HD + full screen!\n\nFun fact: Fellow videographer CYUL Plane Spotter caught this very aircraft at Montreal-Mirabel Airport, check out his video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_xARe-SGHI\n\nThanks for watching!

 "description": "Hey everyone, this is sadly my final Paine Field video :( I'll definitely go back someday, I'm just not sure when. I also changed the size of the borders, I think it still makes it look professional, but not cropping out too much of the video. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this montage of GE-90s, GEnxs, CFM56s, and Trent 1000s at Paine Field.\n\nThanks for watching!

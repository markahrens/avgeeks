 "description": "Well, this is probably the last time I'll use this spot.\n\nTraffic...\nWildlife...\nChildren...\n\n*Sigh* I have lots of other spots though, and it's possible to get rotations from them, which is the only good thing about this spot ;) Anyway, here we have the largest aircraft Calgary gets on a regular basis, the mighty 747-8F departing Calgary for Luxembourg, on a rare daylight flight. I hope you enjoy, and sorry for all the background noise. I think that creaking sound is a frog or something :P\n\nThanks for watching!

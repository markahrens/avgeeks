 "description": "First time catching one of Air Canada's \"sardine can\" 77Ws, one of 5 such configured aircraft in the fleet at the moment. Here is fin number 745 landing at Vancouver International Airport on Runway 08L, with some sweet GE90 sound and spray! I really like how this clip turned out, the look of the aircraft on short final and the touchdown shot are just great. I hope you enjoy the video.\n\nThanks for watching!

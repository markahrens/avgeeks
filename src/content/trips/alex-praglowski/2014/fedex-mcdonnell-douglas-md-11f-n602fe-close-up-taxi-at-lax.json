 "description": "MD-11! :D :D :D You can probably imagine the look of sheer joy  on my face when I saw this bird taxiing ;) \n\nHere is one of FedEx's beautiful MD-11s taxiing from the maintenance area (I think) to the cargo ramp. Just listen to those CF-6s humming, and watch how it \"climbs\" over 2 runways to get to its destination! Hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

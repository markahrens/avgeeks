 "name": "British Airways 787-8 Dreamliner [G-ZBJC] INAUGURAL Landing in Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "After several months of waiting, and numerous delays, the British Airways 787 has finally touched down in YYC. Calgary International Airport now officially has a daily 787 flight. This aircraft will bring a brand new level of comfort to the passengers on British Airways flights 103 and 102. Right at the end of the video, listen to all the spotters cheering and applauding :)\n\nThe video features the aircraft approaching and touching down on YYC's Runway 17L, and then features a close up shot of the aircraft taxiing into the gate. I must say, the lighting in the video is quite spectacular. The 787 already looks beautiful, but it looks even better in the last light of the day. Fun fact: I saw this plane on the flightline when I went to Paine Field last year! I hope you guys enjoy the video as much as I did filming it :)\n\nThanks for watching!

 "description": "My very first time flying on a 737-900! An awesome takeoff on YYC's Runway 29, and a great way to start my San Diego vacation! :D I flew this 739 to Denver, and onwards to San Diego, both flights being operated by 737s. I'll making a trip report eventually, but only the YYC-DEN leg, because I wanted to save some memory on my camera. Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy this beautiful afternoon takeoff!\n\nThanks for watching!

 "name": "Calgary International Airport 2014 - A Year to Remember ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "2014 was easily the best year of spotting I've ever had at YYC. A 787 Dreamliner landed here for the first time, a new runway opened, the President of France paid us a visit, Cathay Pacific Cargo started flights here, and we spotters were treated to a multitude of rare aircraft thanks to the Royal Air Force. This music video features the rare visitors of 2014 and the other milestones for our airport. Bear in mind, I didn't catch every single rare plane, but I still managed to catch quite a few! Enjoy the video, and here's to an equally successful 2015! \n\nThanks for watching!

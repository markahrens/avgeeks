 "description": "Here it is, my final LAX video. What better way to end it than with a heavy? I still have some stuff coming from SAN though ;) Anyway, this is one of United Airlines' Boeing 777s departing LAX with some great lighting and lots of condensation! Pretty sweet sound from those engines too. Hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

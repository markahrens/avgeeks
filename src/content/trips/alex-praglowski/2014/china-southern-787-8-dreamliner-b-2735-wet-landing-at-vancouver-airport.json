 "name": "China Southern 787-8 Dreamliner [B-2735] Wet Landing at Vancouver Airport ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "Best livery on the 787, no doubt about it. Here is China Southern's daily flight to Vancouver touching down on 08L, with some incredible spray from the thrust reversers. Check out the beginning section as the aircraft emerges from the clouds! Also included are ATC communications throughout the video.\n\nAfter an alright day of spotting the previous day, I decided to try out a different location further west along the north side of YVR, and ended up on this hill. As you can see, the view is pretty darn spectacular! I got 3 heavies from this perspective before the wind changed and they started landing the other direction. I have to say, I think this is one of my better videos, hopefully you do as well. Enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

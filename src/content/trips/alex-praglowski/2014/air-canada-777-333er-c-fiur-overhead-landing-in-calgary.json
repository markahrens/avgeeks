 "name": "Air Canada 777-333ER [C-FIUR] Overhead Landing in Calgary ᴴᴰ",
 "description": "I've been planning to catch a 777 overhead ever since I heard that AC was bringing the 77W back for 2014's summer season, and now I finally have! Man this was awesome to experience! This video features a short timelapse of the approach (a little bumpy, wouldn't you say?), the approach and overhead, and then another view of the overhead and final approach, shot with an iPhone 5. I hope you enjoy the video, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

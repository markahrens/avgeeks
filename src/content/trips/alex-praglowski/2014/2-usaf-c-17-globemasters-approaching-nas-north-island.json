 "description": "Hey everyone, a new San Diego video for you, 2 Boeing C-17s doing some fancy turns while approaching Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California. I filmed these clips from my hotel room's balcony, which, as you'll see in the clips, doesn't have a very panoramic view :P I filmed a bunch of departures from SAN here too, but they're only a few seconds of footage :/ Anyway, I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

 "name": "NEW LIVERY! WestJet Encore Dash 8-400 at Calgary Airport! (4K)",
 "description": "On November 2nd, the very first WestJet Encore Dash 8-400 in the new livery flew into Calgary!\n\nThis plane, Tail 401, was the first Dash 8 delivered to Encore just over 10 years ago, and had been in Muskoka, Ontario for the last three weeks getting painted.\n\nSeeing as the first passenger 737-800 was also painted recently, WestJet’s new livery is now, finally, on at least one of every aircraft type that they fly. It is so good to finally see this livery on the Dash 8, and it looks fantastic.\n\nIts first arrival here in the new paint was unfortunately after sunset, but it quickly re-entered service the next day, starting with this flight to Edmonton and back. Please enjoy this great looking Dash 8-400 in its new paint!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

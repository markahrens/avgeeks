 "name": "NORTHERN ONTARIO AVIATION! Plane Spotting at Timmins Victor M. Power Airport",
 "description": "Back in the fall, @MarkBrandonAviation and I went back to the city of Timmins in Northern Ontario to better catch Air Creebec's Hawker Siddeley HS 748s in action. We managed to do just that, and more, with some stunning fall backgrounds!\n\nTimmins is home to 41,000 people, and the airport is fairly busy, serving as a hub of sorts for remote communities along the James Bay coast. The airport also has a number of regular passenger flights to Toronto from Air Canada Express and Porter, in addition to medevac traffic.\n\nA big thank you to those that made this video possible.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

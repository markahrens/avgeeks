 "name": "RARE VISITOR! Egyptair Boeing 777-300ER at Calgary Airport (YYC)",
 "description": "On Wednesday July 12th, this Egyptair 777-300ER flew into Calgary from Cairo! Yes, I did post a video of this very airplane recently in Edmonton, but it turned out there was another one of these refugee flights planned to come to Calgary about two weeks after that one.\n\nEgyptair is still an incredibly uncommon sight in Western Canada, and so it was definitely worth filming this rare 777 again, at home this time, and much closer up too! It arrived around 5AM on Wednesday and left around the same time on Thursday morning heading back to Egypt. Enjoy the video!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

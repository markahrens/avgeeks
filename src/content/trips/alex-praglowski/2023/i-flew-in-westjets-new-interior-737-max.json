 "name": "I Flew in WestJet's NEW INTERIOR 737 MAX!",
 "description": "Around this time last year, WestJet quietly introduced a new interior on their latest 737 MAXs.\n\nPhysically, this new cabin is essentially the same as the rest of the MAX fleet, but has some new touches bringing it more in line with those on their 787s.\n\nThis is a pretty noteworthy change since, with the exception of the new premium seats, the look of their 737 cabin hasn’t changed much in the last couple of years.\n\nI lucked out with one of these new interior planes on a flight from Ottawa to Calgary back in March, and I thought it was worth taking a closer look!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOURCES:\nWestJet MAX 8/10 new seat map: https://news.paxeditions.com/news/airline/westjet-integrate-sunwing-mainline-reconfigure-aircraft-memo-shows\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet (WJA.WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-8 MAX (B38M)\nFlight Number: WS613\nSeat: 15F (Economy)\nLivery: Revised (2022)\nEngines: 2x CFM LEAP-1B\nRegistration: C-GPFT\nRoute: Ottawa (YOW) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WESTJET 613\nRunway used: 25 (YOW) - 35R (YYC)\nDate filmed: March 2023\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2023\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

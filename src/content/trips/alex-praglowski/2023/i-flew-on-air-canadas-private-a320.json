 "name": "I Flew on Air Canada's PRIVATE A320!",
 "description": "In addition to their regular flights, Air Canada operates one Airbus A319 and a few A320s for charters, which have only Business Class seats on board!\n\nThese are the planes that fly NHL teams around North America, and they’re usually pretty busy during hockey season. However, sometimes they do need to reposition planes around the country for specific teams’ needs, and sometimes, that means putting them on a revenue flight for a few lucky passengers!\n\nI heard about one of those very flights earlier this month, and it was certainly a memorable one!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada Jetz (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Airbus A320-211 (A320)\nFlight Number: AC352 \nSeat: 2A\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x CFM56-5A1\nRegistration: C-FKPT \nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Ottawa (YOW)\nCallsign: AIR CANADA 352\nRunway used: 35R (YYC) - 07 (YOW)\nDate filmed: April 2023\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2023\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "description": "Back at the start of June, quite a few interesting military aircraft paid a visit to Halifax Stanfield International Airport in Nova Scotia, Canada! This included up to 6 KC-135s from the U.S. Air Force, plus some other aircraft from the Royal Air Force and Italian Air Force too. \n\nThe KC-135s were apparently doing a training exercise in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but the others were likely just transiting through Halifax. Still very glad to have seen all of this action - this is the first time I've been able to film a KC-135 in flight!\n\nI happened to be there in early June doing some plane spotting, and compiled all of the military stuff I saw into this video! Hope you enjoy this rare military action!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

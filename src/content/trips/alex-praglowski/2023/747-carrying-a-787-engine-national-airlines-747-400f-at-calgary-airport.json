 "description": "On Thursday, August 24th, this Boeing 747-400 Freighter from National Airlines paid a visit to Calgary! It's not often we get to see 747s here in daylight, so this was a rare treat to see in some gorgeous evening sunlight.\n\nAs for why it was here, well there was nothing officially said, but they did load a General Electric GEnx engine, the type used on WestJet's Boeing 787s. \n\nIt seems one of their Dreamliners flew into London-Heathrow on Tuesday, but its return flight was cancelled and it hasn't flown since. Seeing as this 747 spent about 4 hours on the ground here before departing for Heathrow, too, well, you can draw your own conclusions from there.\n\nIt was pretty cool to watch a big jet engine like that being loaded on a 747, which was no small undertaking. Enjoy this rare visitor with some unusual cargo!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

 "description": "This past weekend, the U.S. Air Force sent one of their B-52 Stratofortresses to the Abbotsford Airshow in British Columbia. \n\nThe Abbotsford Airshow typically has a great line-up of aircraft on static display, and this was the first time a B-52 had been here in a couple of years. These jet bombers have been in service with the U.S. Air Force since 1955, and have been, quote, the backbone of the country's strategic bomber force.\n\nPowered by 8 Pratt and Whitney TF33 engines, these slightly newer B-52H models are the last variant still in service. This particular B-52 was built in the early 1960s and is based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. It stayed on static display for all three days of the show and then left early on Monday morning heading back home. \n\nI've never had the chance to see a B-52 flying for myself, so wanting to hear these classic engines before they eventually get replaced with much quieter ones, I made the trip over from Calgary to see it depart after the show!\n\nEnjoy this spectacularly loud departure!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

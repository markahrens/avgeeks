 "name": "MILITARY A321NEO! German Air Force Airbus A321LR at Calgary Airport (YYC)",
 "description": "On Sunday evening, this German Air Force A321neo flew into Calgary International Airport! It stayed overnight and flew back the following afternoon to Germany, via Iceland.\n\nI don't know why they were here, but these sorts of military visitors are not uncommon throughout the summer in Calgary. What is unusual though is the fact that it's a military A321neo, specifically, the LR version! \n\nThis one was officially delivered just over a year ago, and was apparently the first ever Airbus \"neo\" intended for military use. These will be used by the German Air Force for transport and medical evacuation flights, and they have two of these in the fleet as of now. \n\nVery cool to see this new plane in person! Enjoy the video!\n\nSOURCES: \nhttps://www.airdatanews.com/german-air-force-takes-delivery-of-the-worlds-first-military-airbus-a321/\nhttps://www.lufthansa-technik.com/en/handover-of-the-first-airbus-a321lr-to-the-german-armed-forces-6a3ed64bded177ce\nhttps://defbrief.com/2022/08/13/german-air-force-receives-second-a321-long-range-troop-transport/\nhttps://www.aeroflap.com.br/en/germany-receives-brand-new-airbus-a321neo-the-first-to-be-used-in-military-transport/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

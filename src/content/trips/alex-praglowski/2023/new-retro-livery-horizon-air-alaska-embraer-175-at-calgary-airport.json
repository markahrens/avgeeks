 "name": "NEW RETRO LIVERY! Horizon Air (Alaska) Embraer 175 at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Back at the end of December, Calgary got a visit from Horizon Air's new retro livery Embraer 175! \n\nOperating for Alaska Airlines, this E175 is painted in Horizon Air's original 1980s colours, and replaces a Dash 8 that was painted in this livery too.\n\nAlaska has mostly sent Embraers on their Seattle to Calgary route for the last few years now, and it's nice to have another special livery on the E175! Enjoy this great-looking retro livery's first visit to Calgary.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

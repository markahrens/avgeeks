 "name": "48-YEAR-OLD BOEING 737-200 STILL FLYING! Nolinor Aviation at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Last Friday, this Boeing 737-200 from Nolinor Aviation paid a visit to Calgary! They flew in from Vancouver and then departed for Regina, with Charlottetown as their final destination.\n\nI suspect it had cargo on board for the 2023 Canada Winter Games, which are happening this week in PEI.\n\nWhat’s even more interesting though is that this plane is one of the oldest 737s still flying in the world, at 48 years old!\n\nSadly the 737-200s are not as common here as they used to be, and although we do have a few resident -200s, it’s always a treat to see one flying! Enjoy this rare classic visitor!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

 "name": "18 MINS of BIG MILITARY PLANES! Abbotsford Airshow Departures (4K)",
 "description": "The Abbotsford Airshow is the largest airshow in Western Canada, and (usually) takes place every year in August. The 2023 show had a great lineup of aircraft on static and flying display, particularly with the U.S. Air Force bringing a B-52, C-5, KC-135, and C-17, in addition to their EA-18s (not in the video) F-35s, and F-15s.\n\nI stuck around after the show the following Monday to catch some of these U.S. and Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft departing Abbotsford for their respective home bases. It's a rare opportunity (at least, here in Canada) to see so many military planes on the move in a short period of time like this, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

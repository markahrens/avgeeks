 "name": "DIVERSION! Turkish Airlines 777-300ER Takeoff from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "On June 28th, this Turkish Airlines 777-300ER diverted to Calgary while en route from Istanbul to San Francisco.\n\nAlthough Turkish does serve three Canadian destinations, those being Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal, they are not an airline you'd ever expect to see in Calgary. This might be one of the first times they've been here.\n\nUnfortunately the diversion was due to a medical emergency on board, so I do hope everybody's alright. Hope you enjoy this rare visitor.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

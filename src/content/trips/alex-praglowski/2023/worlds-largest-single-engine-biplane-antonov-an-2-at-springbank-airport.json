 "name": "WORLD'S LARGEST SINGLE-ENGINE BIPLANE! Antonov An-2 at Springbank Airport",
 "description": "The Antonov An-2 is a Soviet-era utility biplane that was produced from the late 1940s all the way until 2001. Thanks to its rugged design, short takeoff and landing capability, and highly adaptable airframe, over 18,000 of these planes were built. That said, they're not a super common sight in North America.\n\nFor the past couple of years though, two of these planes have been based out of Springbank Airport just west of Calgary. This is where the story gets interesting!\n\nBoth of these planes are owned by a company called \"2Solitude\" (https://www.2solitude.com), which retrofits An-2s and turns them into, basically, flying RVs!\n\nOne of them is privately operated and has a full interior with a kitchen and everything, sitting on the world's largest composite floats! The other one is a test bed for a turboprop conversion, swapping out the original radial engine for a Honeywell TPE331-12 turbine. This one too, will get its own set of floats eventually.\n\nThe final result is, to paraphrase the company's website, \"a bush plane that is your camp\".\n\nOn Saturday, the turbine one went up for a couple of circuits, and I took the opportunity to finally catch this rare Soviet biplane in action. A big thank you to the 2Solitude team for letting me take a look around the planes, too!

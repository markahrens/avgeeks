 "name": "RARE VISITOR! Royal Canadian Air Force CC-138 Twin Otter at Calgary Springbank Airport [4K]",
 "description": "A couple weeks ago, this Royal Canadian Air Force CC-138 Twin Otter paid a visit to Calgary. This visitor from 440 Squadron spent a few days at Calgary’s Springbank Airport, apparently giving some rides to Air Cadets.\n\nThe RCAF only has 4 of these planes and they’re based out of Yellowknife for transport and search and rescue operations up north, so they're not a common sight here at all. That, plus Springbank backgrounds, meant I had to go film a few of those flights for myself.

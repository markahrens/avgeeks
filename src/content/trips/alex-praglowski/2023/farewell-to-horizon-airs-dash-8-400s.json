 "name": "FAREWELL to Horizon Air's Dash 8-400s!",
 "description": "Last year, it was announced that Alaska Air Group would be retiring their fleet of Dash 8-400s by the end of January 2023.\n\nThese 76-seater turboprops have been flown by Horizon Air for Alaska Airlines since the early 2000s, connecting communities within the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSadly though, the type is being retired in favour of streamlining the Alaska and Horizon Air fleets, despite some of them being less than 10 years old.\n\nAlthough there is no shortage of Dash 8s up here in Canada, it'll be weird not seeing any more of these Alaska ones in Alberta and B.C.\n\nSo, I thought I would put together this compilation of Horizon Air Dash 8-400s from the past couple of years, including some footage from Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria, and some from a trip to Portland last summer.\n\nFarewell Horizon Air Dash 8s, and I hope you enjoy the video. \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

 "name": "FAREWELL to Canadian North's Boeing 737-200! One Last Flight on a Classic",
 "description": "The Boeing 737-200 Combi is an aircraft that's almost synonymous with Canada's North. With its gravel runway and combi capability, it's been serving Northern Canadian communities for decades, as an important lifeline.\n\nSadly though, Canada will be losing another operator of the type as Canadian North retires their final one from the fleet. It flew its final passenger flight in the first week of May, and although I wasn't able to be there for it, I made a trip up in late April to make sure I got one last flight in.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Canadian North (AKT/5T)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-200 Combi (B73M)\nFlight Number: 5T226\nSeat: 17F/18F/14F\nLivery: Old (Polar Bear)\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney JT8D-17\nRegistration: C-GDPA\nRoute: Yellowknife (YZF) - Cambridge Bay (YCB) - Kugluktuk (YCO) - Yellowknife (YZF)\nCallsign: ARCTIC 226\nRunway used: 16 (YZF) - 31T (YCB) - 30T/12T (YCO) - 16 (YZF)\nDate filmed: April 2023\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2023\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "name": "Why Canada's Longest Runway Exists",
 "description": "Runway 17L/35R at Calgary International Airport has the distinction of being the longest runway in all of Canada, at 14,000 feet. On first glance, that seems like an absurd amount of runway, especially for all the short and medium-haul traffic the airport gets. \n\nSo, why does Calgary have a runway that’s over 4 kilometres long?\n\nDISCLAIMER: All aerial photos and videos of the airport were taken either by myself as a passenger, or by mounted GoPros. ATC instructions were complied with at all times.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOURCES:\nCanada Flight Supplement\n\nPassenger statistics:\nhttps://www.yyc.com/en-us/media/factsfigures/passengerstatistics.aspx\n\n“Hot and High” Operations:\nhttps://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Hot_and_High_Operations\n\nYYC's New Runway:\nhttp://www.calgaryherald.com/million+runway+takes+Calgary+airport/9941668/story.html\n\nhttps://airportimprovement.com/drupal772/index.php/calgary-intl-builds-canadas-longest-runway?q=article/calgary-intl-builds-canadas-longest-runway\n\nhttps://www.skiesmag.com/news/canadaslongestrunwayopensincalgary/\n\nhttps://www.skiesmag.com/news/canadaslongestrunwaytoopeninjune/\n\nhttps://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/others/2012/2/Calgary-airport-expansion-includes-building-Canadas-longest-runway-JOC048967W?cmpid=RSS%7Cheavyequipment/\n\nhttps://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/51-209-x/2015001/technote-notetech2-eng.htm\n\nRCAF Station Namao/CFB Edmonton:\nhttp://wayback.archive-it.org/2217/20101208165515/http://www.abheritage.ca/aviation/history/military_namao.html\n\nhttps://edmonton-real-estate-agents.com/blog.html/cfb-edmonton-garrison-history-5922244\n\nhttps://militarybruce.com/abandoned-canadian-military-bases/the-future/alberta/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

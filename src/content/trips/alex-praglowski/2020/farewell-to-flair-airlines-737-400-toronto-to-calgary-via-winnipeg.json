 "description": "Along with many other aircraft retirements around the world this year, Flair has officially said goodbye to their Boeing 737-400s.\n\nWhile these were planned to leave the fleet by the end of the year, their final revenue flights took place in March, and the remaining three aircraft had been stored. \n\nThroughout August, they all departed Canada for a new owner, quietly closing this chapter in Flair Airlines' history.\n\nSo long, 737-400!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nDISCLAIMER: The ticket for this flight was paid for by Flair Airlines.

 "name": "The LAST EVER Air Canada E190 Flight - Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "The Embraer 190 was the smallest mainline aircraft in the Air Canada fleet, seating just 97 passengers, and served the airline from 2005 to 2020.\n\nSadly though, their retirement (among other aircraft) has been accelerated due to the ongoing global crisis, and they flew their final revenue flights at the end of May, with the majority of the fleet being sent to the desert for retirement.\n\nThere was one lone holdout though - Fin 340 stayed in the Calgary hangar for a little while longer, before it left this morning for Tucson, Arizona, as the very last Air Canada Embraer 190 flight.\n\nHere's C-FNAJ taxiing by, doing an engine run-up, and taking off from runway 17L into the history books, with a great exchange between the crew and ATC.\n\nBig thank you as well to Geoff Nicholas for the awesome photos of the nose gear door at the start of the video.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Embraer 190 (E190)\nFlight Number: AC2337\nLivery: Old (2005-2017)\nEngines: 2x GE CF34-10E5 \nRegistration: C-FNAJ\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Tucson (TUS)\nCallsign: AIR CANADA 2337\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: June 12, 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

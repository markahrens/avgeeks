 "description": "Way back in March of 2015, I visited Japan for the first time, and spent an afternoon at the observation deck at Tokyo-Narita International Airport!\n\nI recently rediscovered this footage on an old hard drive, and realized how many of the aircraft I caught just aren't around anymore.\n\nAlthough the camera work is a bit dodgy and that 2015 me had no concept of backlighting, I think some of these catches have aged really well - tons of now-retired 747s, A340s, 767s, and much more! Hope you all enjoy.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "name": "MORNING RUSH at the WORLD'S BUSIEST AIRPORT - Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Plane Spotting",
 "description": "Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is the busiest airport in the world, having served over 110 million passengers in 2019 alone. As Delta's corporate headquarters and largest hub, over 1,000 flights leave here each day, making for a super fast-paced plane spotting experience.\n\nI paid a visit to Atlanta in January with some friends of mine to cross off a flight on the Delta MD-88, and we stayed at the Renaissance Concourse Atlanta Airport Hotel, which is well-known for its fantastic views of the north runways. This 25+ minute plane spotting compilation is just a glimpse of the constant flow of arrivals and departures on a typical January morning in sunny Georgia!\n\nWith thanks to @mlcochran78 for his generous hospitality while we were there. \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "name": "FLYING A 29-YEAR-OLD MD-88! The End of an Era at Delta Air Lines",
 "description": "The McDonnell-Douglas MD-80 is an updated and stretched version of the venerable Douglas DC-9. Delta has flown these aircraft for decades all across North America, but will sadly be retiring them in early June.\n\nIn January this year, I made a particularly well-timed trip to cross off at least one flight on the \"Mad Dog\" with some friends of mine, and I'm so glad I did. See what I thought of the MD-88 in this trip report!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Delta Air Lines (DAL/DL)\nAircraft: McDonnell-Douglas MD-88 (MD88)\nFlight Number: DL2550\nSeat: 33A\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney JT8D-219\nRegistration: N966DL\nRoute: Atlanta (ATL) - Toronto (YYZ)\nCallsign: DELTA 2550\nRunway used: 26L (ATL) - 06L (YYZ)\nDate filmed: January 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

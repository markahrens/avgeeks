 "description": "Air Transat is Canada's third largest airline, and also the only operator of any Airbus A320neo family aircraft in the entire country!\n\nThat alone makes them stand out a fair bit, since Air Canada, WestJet, and Sunwing, all went with Boeing for their single-aisle replacements.\n\nAfter 4 months without flying, it was great to see Air Transat back in the skies, and I wanted to see what it was like flying with them now, on board their very first A321neo!\n\n*With thanks to @JonathanWinton123 for the Wizz Air cameo!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Transat (TSC/TS)\nAircraft: Airbus A321-271NX (A21N)\nFlight Number: TS125\nSeat: 5A\nLivery: New\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney PW1133G\nRegistration: C-GOIE\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Montreal-Trudeau (YUL)\nCallsign: TRANSAT 125\nRunway used: 35L (YYC) - 24L (YUL)\nFlight Time: 3h45m\nDate filmed: Summer 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\n#TallPeopleFlying\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

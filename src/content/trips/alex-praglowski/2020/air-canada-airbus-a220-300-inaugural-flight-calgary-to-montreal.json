 "name": "Air Canada Airbus A220-300 INAUGURAL FLIGHT! Calgary to Montreal",
 "description": "On January 16th, Air Canada flew the first revenue flights of their new Airbus A220-300, and I was on board the first flight from Calgary to Montreal!\n\nAir Canada ordered 45 of the A220-300 variant in 2016 with options for an additional 30 aircraft. Back then, the program was still known as the Bombardier CSeries, before its much-discussed sale to Airbus in 2018. \n\nAir Canada was, however, the first North American airline to place orders for the aircraft, so it’s understandably a pretty big deal for them to finally launch revenue flights.\n\nSee what I thought of Air Canada's new bird on its first day of operations!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Airbus A220-300 (BCS3)\nFlight Number: AC318\nSeat: 21A\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney PW1500G\nRegistration: C-GROV\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Montreal (YUL)\nCallsign: AIR CANADA 318\nRunway used: 17L (YYC) - 06R (YUL)\nDate filmed: January 16th, 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

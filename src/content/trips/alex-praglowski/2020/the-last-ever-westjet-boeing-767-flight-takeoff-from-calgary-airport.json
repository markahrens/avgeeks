 "name": "The LAST EVER WestJet Boeing 767 Flight - Takeoff from Calgary Airport",
 "description": "After 5 years of having the 767 in their fleet, WestJet has officially retired its fourth and last aircraft.\n\nC-FOGT, Tail 673, departed Calgary this morning for the very last time for Lake City, Florida to join the other three aircraft at their new life with Amazon Prime Air.\n\nI definitely feel an attachment to these planes, having caught the delivery flights of all four back when they first arrived in Calgary, and they'll be missed! By WestJet maintenance and customer service though, perhaps not so much.\n\nSo long, 767!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-338ER(WL)\nFlight Number: WS8962\nLivery: Revised (2015) \nEngines: 2x General Electric CF6-80\nRegistration: C-FOGT\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Lake City (LCQ)\nCallsign: WESTJET 8962 heavy\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: September 16th 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "name": "SMOKY CITY TOUR! Flying Around Edmonton in a Cessna 172",
 "description": "Having just completed my Private Pilot's License, I thought it was about time I took a passenger with me (and recorded it)!\n\nIn mid-September, smoke from all of the forest fires along the coast quickly brought the visibility down all across the province, but this particular day in Edmonton only brought it down to 8 miles.\n\nThat's still well within limits for VFR, and it ended up being quite a smooth day over Alberta's capital city! \n\nDISCLAIMER: This is a non-instructional video and should not be used for flight training purposes. All video footage was recorded with a mounted GoPro or filmed handheld by my passenger.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nOwner: Namao Flying Club\nAircraft: Cessna 172M Skyhawk II (C172)\nSeat: Left\nLivery: White with Blue\nEngines: 1x Avco Lycoming O-320-E2D\nRegistration: C-GJJL\nRoute: CZVL-CZVL\nCallsign: Cessna 172 Golf Juliet Juliet Lima\nRunway used: 16\nDate filmed: September 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

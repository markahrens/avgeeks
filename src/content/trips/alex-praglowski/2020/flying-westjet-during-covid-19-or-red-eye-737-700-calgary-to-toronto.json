 "name": "Flying WestJet During COVID-19 | Red-Eye 737-700 Calgary to Toronto",
 "description": "As Canada begins to reopen, I thought it would be interesting to see what it’s like to fly with WestJet in this current climate, and I purposely booked a trip with them out east so that I could return home within 24 hours.\n\nThis was all done safely though - I wore a mask for the duration and went through multiple pairs of gloves for different stages. I knew I was healthy going in, and was tested negative for COVID-19 when I returned home.\n\nSee what it's like flying with WestJet in these not-so-normal times!\n\nSpecial thanks to my buddy Will for the killer thumbnail shot of my actual flight!

 "name": "FINAL FLIGHT! Finnair A350-900 Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport [4K]",
 "description": "Over the past couple of months, Calgary has been fortunate enough to have Finnair's Airbus A350s here, operating flights for Eurowings Discover. \n\nAs the summer season winds down though, their final flight for the season took place last Saturday.\n\nEurowings Discover will apparently be returning next year, but I doubt we'll ever see those Finnair A350s again. Glad we had them while we did!\n\nEnjoy this video of their final arrival and departure.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

 "description": "On Sunday, August 28th, FedEx sent one of their McDonnell Douglas MD-10 freighters to Calgary on the usual flight from Memphis.\n\nThis marks the first time a DC-10 of any sort has been to Calgary in over 7 years, since Kelowna Flightcraft stopped flying theirs here in 2015.\n\nPersonally, these are some of my all time favourite airplanes, and what makes this even more exciting is that these and the larger MD-11s will apparently become a regular sight here over the next couple months.\n\nSo, my sincere thank you to whoever at FedEx made that decision, and enjoy the video.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

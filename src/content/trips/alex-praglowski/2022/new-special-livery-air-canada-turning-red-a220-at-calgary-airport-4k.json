 "name": "NEW SPECIAL LIVERY! Air Canada \"Turning Red\" A220 at Calgary Airport (4K)",
 "description": "On February 8th, Air Canada unveiled a new special livery, promoting the new Pixar movie \"Turning Red\"! The movie is set in Toronto, and so it seems fitting that AC has collaborated with Disney to put this livery on one of their Airbus A220s. It flew into Calgary for the first time on February 10th, and I naturally had to go see it.\n\nI will say, it's definitely unique and possibly the first time Air Canada's ever done this sort of thing. Either way, nice to have something different to spot from Air Canada! Plus, there seemed to be a bit of an issue with the APU on the taxi in, which made things interesting. Enjoy the video!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video!

 "name": "TURBINE DC-3s IN ACTION! Kenn Borek Air Basler BT-67s at Calgary Airport [4K]",
 "description": "Kenn Borek Air is a Calgary-based operator that specializes in operating in remote areas around the world. Every fall, they begin ramping up training flights in preparation for their annual trip to Antarctica for the Antarctic summer season.\n\nThey operate Beech 1900s, King Airs, Twin Otters, and several Basler BT-67s - a turbine conversion of the Douglas DC-3. These are some of the most unique aircraft we see at Calgary International Airport, and I filmed a few of these in action over the past couple of days.

 "description": "Montreal Mirabel International Airport, located north of Montreal, was originally built to replace Dorval Airport as the main airport of Montreal. \n\nPassenger service to Mirabel ultimately didn't stick around for a variety of reasons, but the airport now serves as a busy cargo hub for Montreal, as well as a base for Nolinor Aviation, Pratt & Whitney Canada, and Airbus.\n\nThere's a surprising amount of interesting aircraft to see here, as I found out during this visit for the Pratt & Whitney Canada 747SP back in May!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

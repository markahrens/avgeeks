 "name": "Lynx Air 737 MAX in NORWEGIAN LIVERY?",
 "description": "Last week, Lynx Air took delivery of their fourth 737 MAX, except that much like Flair’s Air Europa ones, it’s not quite in the right livery.\n\nThis was a plane originally destined for Norwegian, and it looks like there wasn’t enough time to fully paint it before it was delivered. At the very least, the Norwegian titles have been painted over and only the basic livery remains.\n\nIt looks like Lynx needed the plane urgently too, since it entered service almost right away, and I managed to film a few clips of on its first few revenue flights in Calgary.

 "name": "RARE VISITOR! Omni Air International 777-200ER at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "On Boxing Day, this Boeing 777 from Omni Air International flew into Calgary, operating a recovery flight for Sunwing!\n\nSunwing, as well as many other Canadian airlines, were quite affected by the bad weather across Canada this past week. This 777 flew up to Edmonton, down to Puerto Vallarta, and then up to Calgary and back to Edmonton, as seen here, presumably with a whole pile of re-accommodated passengers.\n\nOmni Air International is an American charter airline that specializes in charters and wet leases, and it’s been a while since we’ve seen them here. They were a pretty common sight back in 2015/2016 when WestJet was introducing the 767s. Nice to see them again, especially with their triple seven!

 "description": "On June 22nd, Flair Airlines took delivery of another 737 MAX, making it the 16th 737 in their fleet!\n\nHowever, this one was delivered to them in… well, not quite Flair colours. This plane was a MAX that Air Europa of Spain ended up not taking delivery of, and it would appear Boeing didn’t have time to repaint it before Flair needed it.\n\nI’m assuming they might apply some stickers until they’re able to have it fully painted, especially over the SkyTeam logo!\n\nRegardless of how it ends up looking, this will definitely be a unique hybrid livery to see flying across the country.

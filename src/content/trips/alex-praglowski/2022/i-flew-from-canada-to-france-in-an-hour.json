 "description": "Back in the summer, I flew from Canada to France in less than an hour... But how's that possible?\n\nWell, just off the coast of Newfoundland is a tiny French overseas collectivity called Saint Pierre and Miquelon.\n\nThese islands are home to only 6,000 people, and they have their own airline called Air Saint-Pierre!\n\nNeeding to fly from St. John's to Halifax, I decided to make an overnight detour to France to fly with them, and it was a trip to remember.\n\nWith thanks to @MarkBrandonAviation for the use of his photos.\n\nSaint Pierre and Miquelon information sources:\n- https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Miquelon (English pronunciation)\n- https://www.adventurecanada.com/atlantic-canada-sable-island-and-gulf-of-saint-lawrence/a-brief-history-of-saint-pierre-and-miquelon\n- https://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/trip-ideas/travel-stories/5-really-cool-things-about-saint-pierre-and-miquelon\n- https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/05/22/why-a-rocky-archipelago-south-of-newfoundland-is-officially-part-of-france\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Saint-Pierre (SPM/PJ)\nAircraft: ATR 42-600 (AT46)\nFlight Number: PJ1127/11212\nSeat: 3D/1D\nLivery: New (2020)\nEngines: 2x PWC PW127M\nRegistration: F-ORLB\nRoute: St. John's (YYT) - Saint-Pierre (FSP) - Halifax (YHZ)\nCallsign: SAINT PIERRE 1127/1121\nRunway used: 29 (YYT) - 26 (FSP) - 23 (YHZ)\nDate filmed: August 2022\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound.\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2022\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

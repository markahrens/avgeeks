 "name": "I Flew in Business Class... on a CRJ?",
 "description": "The CRJ-900 is a regional airliner that seats around 76 people, and Jazz Aviation operates 35 of these on behalf of Air Canada Express. What’s kind of noteworthy though is that they actually offer a proper domestic Business Class on these planes, with 12 seats in the first four rows.\n\nSo, I fell victim to a compelling check-in upgrade price once again, and flew in Business Class on a CRJ!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada Express (Jazz) (JZA/QK)\nAircraft: Bombardier CRJ-900 (CRJ9)\nFlight Number: AC8391\nSeat: 4A (Business Class)\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x GE CF34-8C5\nRegistration: C-GJZV\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Kelowna (YLW)\nCallsign: JAZZ 391\nRunway used: 35L (YYC) - 16 (YLW)\nDate filmed: May 2022\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2022\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

 "name": "\"NATO Week\" at Calgary International Airport! Military Plane Spotting [4K]",
 "description": "During the first week of July, YYC got some pretty interesting military visitors from the Belgian, French, and Royal Air Forces. These were all bringing troops and equipment for training at Canadian Forces Base Suffield, near Medicine Hat.\n\nThe RAF flies into Calgary fairly often, but it's always this first week of July that seems to bring visitors from the rest of NATO, with the exception of the past two summers. For that reason, Calgary spotters unofficially call this \"NATO Week\". Enjoy these special military catches!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

 "name": "RARE Hawker Siddeley HS 748s STILL FLYING! Air Creebec in Timmins, Ontario [4K]",
 "description": "The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a British turboprop airliner designed in the late 1950s, and was developed as a 40-48 seat replacement for the DC-3.\n\nAs a result, it was built to be a simple and rugged aircraft that could land on unpaved runways and haul north of 12,000 pounds of cargo at a time.\n\nA few of these still fly in Northern Ontario, and with only 5 of these planes total flying in Canada, this is one of the rarest aircraft types in the country.\n\nSo, for @MarkBrandonAviation and I, it was worth making another trip to Timmins, Ontario just to see Air Creebec's two HS 748s in action!\n\nMany thanks to those who helped make these shots possible.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

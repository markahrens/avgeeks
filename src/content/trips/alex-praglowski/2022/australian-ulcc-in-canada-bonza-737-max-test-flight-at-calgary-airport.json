 "name": "AUSTRALIAN ULCC IN CANADA? Bonza 737 MAX Test Flight at Calgary Airport",
 "description": "Back on September 29th, this 737 MAX from Australian ultra-low-cost startup Bonza flew into Calgary from Boeing Field. This is the second aircraft for Bonza, which is still trying to get their Australian Air Operator Certificate at the moment.\n\nObviously, Calgary is in... very much the opposite direction of Australia, so this is a pretty bizarre sight for us! As of uploading this, it is still parked here, but made one short test flight last week, as you'll see in the rest of the video.\n\nTo make things even stranger, this plane was originally ordered by LOT Polish Airlines, but wasn't taken up by them, hence the winglets. \n\nMy best guess as to why it's here is that Bonza and Flair both have a mutual investor in 777 Partners, so Bonza may just be taking advantage of Flair's maintenance facilities and staff. It almost might be cheaper to store it here until they get their AOC rather than fly it across the Pacific and park it there.\n\nRegardless of the actual reason, it's not every day you get to see an Australian registered 737 flying around Calgary, and I'm glad I was able to catch this test flight! Enjoy the video!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

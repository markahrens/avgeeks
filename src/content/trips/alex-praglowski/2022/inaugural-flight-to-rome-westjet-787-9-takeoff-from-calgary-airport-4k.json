 "name": "INAUGURAL FLIGHT TO ROME! WestJet 787-9 Takeoff from Calgary Airport [4K]",
 "description": "After three years in the making, on May 7th, 2022, WestJet flew their inaugural flight from Calgary to Rome!\n\nThis route was first announced back in October of 2019 for a launch in the summer of 2020, which, well, y'know.\n\nIt’s an interesting route for me personally though since I was there nearly 3 years ago when they announced it, so it’s wonderful to finally see this route flying!\n\nI also can’t tell you how nice it is to see Calgary’s international terminal with so many widebody flights again! Hopefully we see some more international traffic coming through this summer.

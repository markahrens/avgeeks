 "name": "THE NEW BOEING 737 MAX 10 and MORE! Plane Spotting at Boeing Field [4K]",
 "description": "Back in August, @BSiskaAviation and I drove down to the US on a bit of a road trip, and on our way there we stopped at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, in the hopes of seeing some flight test action.\n\nThe highlight was Boeing's newest iteration of the 737 MAX—the absurdly-long MAX 10—going up for a quick test flight around the Pacific Northwest. I've also included some other BFI traffic, including a Southwest MAX on a delivery flight plus quite a few bizjets.

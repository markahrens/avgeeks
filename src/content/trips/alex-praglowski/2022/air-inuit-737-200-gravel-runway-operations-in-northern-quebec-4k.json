 "description": "The northern village of Puvirnituq is one of the largest settlements in Quebec's Nunavik region, and sits just above the 60th parallel.\n\nIt's home to an airport with a 6,000+ foot runway, making it one of the few airports in the region able to accommodate a 737. That runway though is made of gravel, and so only the 737-200s with a gravel kit can actually use it.\n\nWith direct scheduled flights to Montreal, that makes Puvirnituq one of the more \"relatively\" accessible places to see a 737-200 in its element. \n\nI found myself there back in April on my way home from Kuujjuaq, and managed to capture one of Air Inuit's 737-200s operating an all-cargo flight to and from Montreal. Enjoy this gravel runway action!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

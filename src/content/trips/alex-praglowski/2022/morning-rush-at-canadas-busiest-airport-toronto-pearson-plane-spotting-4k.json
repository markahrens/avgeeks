 "name": "MORNING RUSH at CANADA'S BUSIEST AIRPORT - Toronto-Pearson Plane Spotting (4K)",
 "description": "Toronto-Pearson International Airport is by far and away the busiest airport in all of Canada, serving over 50 million passengers in 2019. Although traffic hasn't quite reached those levels again, it's pretty close, and the airport is super busy these days!\n\nIn February of 2022, myself and my good friends @BSiskaAviation,@MarkBrandonAviation, and Will (www.instagram.com/willrdaviation) paid a visit to Canada's busiest airport for some spotting, and this 35 minute compilation of departures from runway 06L just scratches the surface of the traffic that YYZ has to offer. \n\nAn enormous thank you as well to our friend Charlie for driving us around that morning! Enjoy the video!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

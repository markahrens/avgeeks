 "name": "Plane Spotting in NORTHERN CANADA! Kuujjuaq Airport, Quebec [4K]",
 "description": "Back in April,  @MarkBrandonAviation  and I spent a couple nights in Kuujjuaq - the largest town in Quebec's north, a region called Nunavik. This region above the 55th parallel is predominantly Inuit, and is home to 14 communities with no road connections.\n\nOf those towns, Kuujjuaq Airport is the only one with a paved runway, and so it's the busiest one in the region by far. Air Inuit serves the local communities with some links to Quebec City and Montreal, and Canadian North also provides direct links to Iqaluit and Montreal.\n\nThere's no shortage of interesting traffic for any aviation enthusiast, so if you'd like to see some plane spotting that's off the beaten path a bit, look no further than here!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

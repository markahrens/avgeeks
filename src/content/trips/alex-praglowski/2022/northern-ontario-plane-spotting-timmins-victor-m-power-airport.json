 "name": "NORTHERN ONTARIO PLANE SPOTTING! Timmins Victor M. Power Airport",
 "description": "Timmins Victor M. Power Airport, located in Northern Ontario, serves around 200,000 passengers a year (pre-2020), with two airlines having a base here - Air Creebec, and Thunder Airlines.\n\nTimmins also gets some traffic from Air Canada and Porter, both of whom fly nonstop to Toronto Pearson and Toronto Billy Bishop Airports, respectively.\n\nThere's also some unique traffic, such as Air Creebec's Hawker Siddeley HS748, which I caught doing an engine run, along with some regular traffic during my visit in early January 2022.\n\nEnjoy the video! And thanks to @MarkBrandonAviation for the excellent company. \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video!

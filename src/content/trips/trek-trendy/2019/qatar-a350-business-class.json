 "description": "Today let's take a look at what it's like to fly on Qatar airways Business class. This is their non q-suite product, but it's still arguably one of the most competitive products out there. It's pretty interesting to compare this to my recent flights on the Virgin and BA A350 which feature closing doors. \n\nToday I'll be looking at the seat, the comfort of the lay flat bed, the food and the overall cabin experience. I can tell you now you will not be disappointed flying this beautiful aircraft. The A350 is pretty wide and with Qatar's configuration where they forego the central overhead bins and no bulkhead between the two business class sections, it feels very spacious and only adds to the comfort. For some I imagine they will prefer this over the Q Suite, as that cabin feels quite enclosed comparably. \n\nAs always let me know what you think in the comments below.

Plenty more Business and First class travels upcoming! \n\nMusic used:\n“Ice Cold” Instrumental by Temper Beats Youtube - https://youtu.be/zGPeuSmyD6Q Spotify - https://spoti.fi/2SVDkjS",

 "name": "SOUTH KOREA ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· - Day 3 Vlog [BBQ, Trains and Busan]",
 "description": "For our last 24 hours in Korea we spent the evening in Hongdae enjoying a traditional Korean hot stone BBQ - which was incredible! We then explored the local area which I feel is strangely reminiscent of Shoreditch in London (mainly the vibe!)\n\nWe even ran into a Korea Twitch streamer and talked about Youtube which was fun! The next day we took a train down to Busan in the South of Korea to catch our flight over to Osaka, Japan where the next vlog will pick up! \n\nMusic Used:\n\"Promise\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/6eoQ7zcAoJQ\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/artist/4msU1...\n\nIf you're in Seoul check out Piggbank \n331-1 Seogyo-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, South Korea",

 "description": "Seeing as British Airways have just introduced a brand new business class, named the Club Suite... I just had to try this for myself! I grabbed my camera and jumped on the A350-1000 flight from London to Toronto. \n\n#BritishAirways #clubsuite #A350\n\nThis was especially interesting to compare to the Virgin Club suites which I flew just a couple of weeks before. And the verdict?! \n\nHonestly it was miles ahead of BA's existing Business class, their Club World product. Each seat has direct aisle access, the suite has it's very private with it's own door. There's a static TV (which means gate to gate entertainment) and a comfortable seat which folds totally flat into a comfortable bed. \n\nIt is however a shame that this is only available on a few of their routes at present. \n\nLet me know what you think in the comments below and if you have not already do subscribe for more content. \n\nMusic used:\n\nhttps://www.epidemicsound.com/track/hbNyf6cEHa\n\n\"Corrupt\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/ZRnNgMlC37c\nSpotify - https://spoti.fi/2SVDkjS",

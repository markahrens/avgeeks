 "description": "Join me on Virgin Atlantic's new Business Class Suites \n\nI’ve just got back from New York on Virgin Atlantic’ brand new A350. I’ve tried out their new Upper Class suites (which is their newest business class product) and I’m pretty impressed! It’s a massive improvement over their last business class, and it’s interesting to see what they’ve done with their A350. Especially as I’ve recently flown the Qatar A350 Q suites. \n\nHope you enjoy my review of the A350 Upper Class, it was awesome to try out, though not long enough for my liking considering it was an overnight redeye. If you liked this video then be sure to check out some of my other Business and First class reviews on the channel.\n\nHeadphones I use here: https://trektrendy.link/Bose_Headphones\n\nMUSIC USED\n\n\"Forever\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/Khg2iF1U3Gg\nSpotify - https://spoti.fi/2SVDkjS",

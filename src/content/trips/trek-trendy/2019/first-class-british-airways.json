 "description": "I recently had the opportunity to try British Airways First Class flying from London Heathrow over to Washington DC. I was able to try out both the 777 and 747, of which i've combined in this video. \n\nCome with me onboard and see what it's like to travel in First. What's the seat like? How is the bed? What's the food like? How does it compare to other First Class products? \n\nAs always let me know what you think in the comments below. And if you haven't already smash that subscribe button for plenty more luxury travel content to come! \n\nMUSIC USED:\n\n\"Undercover\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/dPdoxIz0w24\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/artist/4msU1...\n\nTrack: Different Story â€” Another Kid [Audio Library Release]\nMusic provided by Audio Library Plus\nWatch: https://youtu.be/LgGurhDjE5c",

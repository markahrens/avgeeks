 "name": "TrekTrendy - July/August Romania, Moldova, Transnistria, Ukraine epic adventure - Country #7/8 of 12",
 "description": "In July/August 2015 my friends and I visited 4 very interesting and unique countries in Eastern Europe in a week long journey. Arriving in Bucharest Romania, saw partying, a waterpark, a healthy dose of culture and wonderful Romanian cuisine. Next, we took a 12 hour mini bus ride up to Chișinău in Moldova. We stayed for a few nights here, touring the city, enjoying incredibly priced food, played giant chess, and even had a workout, Moldovan style complete with a Sauna. We then boarded a train which went through our third stop Transnistria, allowing us a short time near the capital city of Tiraspol. This tiny soviet state fascinated us, and I managed to get some footage of this rarely documented hermit nation. It actually seemed quite nice in the August sunshine. Our train terminated in the Ukrainian port town of Odessa. We were staying in the resort district of Arcadia, on the beach and in the heart of some of the most incredible partying we had ever experienced. I would most recommend Ibiza, a superclub on the beach. We also toured Odessa city and saw the famous catacombs under the city. Finally we took a short flight up to Kiev to finish our adventure in the Ukrainian capital with a days sightseeing and final nights partying. All in all a fantastic trip with memories which will last a lifetime.",

 "name": "ENGLISH LAD GOES TO UKRAINE - Country #6 of 12",
 "description": "June saw my 6th trip of the year to the Ukrainian capital Kiev, and my what a trip! I flew on Ukrainian International airlines from London Gatwick for a long weekend in this incredible country. I went with an open mind and came back with a new favourite country to add to the list. We stayed centrally in the Ibis hotel, close to the University metro station allowing easy access throughout the city. In short, I experienced staggering architecture, with golden cathedrals & palaces, eat exceedingly good Ukrainian cuisine, went lifting on one of Kiev's beaches and partied Kiev style. My aim now is to educate others about this fantastic country, and encourage you to do the same. Let's change the fact we only hear negative publicity about this wonderful country, share this video to encourage others to experience the same fantastic holiday I have had #VisitUkraine",

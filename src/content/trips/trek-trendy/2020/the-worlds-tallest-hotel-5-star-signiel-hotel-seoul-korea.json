 "description": "Come and explore one of the world's tallest hotels with me. Today i'm staying on the 96th floor of the luxury Signiel Hotel in Seoul, South Korea. This is at the top of the Lotte World tower and billed as one of the world's most luxurious hotels (and even unofficially stated as a 6 star hotel).\n\n#signielhotel #korea #luxuryhotel\n\nAt 123 stories high, complete with the world's highest ballroom, one of the highest pools, and some of the most breathtaking views you just have to check out this incredible hotel! I will share with you my experience each step of the way, from having a bath on the 96th floor to swimming overlooking Seoul. I review this 5* luxury hotel and give you my feedback on just how good one of the world's tallest hotels really is?!",

I won't be doing it alone either, I'll have one of my buddies James Asquith with me as well as a new friend, Diego the dog! From airport to airport we're looking at over 31 hours today, and I'm sure we'll get into some adventures along the way. \n\nGo check out my buddy James' new YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqU2YGi4Jcdlx8sHsq0VRVQ\n\nFollow my travels on my IG: will.luxurytravel\n\n------------\n\nQatar QSuites\nQatar A350\nQatar 777\nQatar Business Class\nWorld's Best Business Class",

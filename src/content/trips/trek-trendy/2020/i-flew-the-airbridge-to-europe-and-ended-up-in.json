 "description": "What is it like to fly Business Class into Europe after lockdown? What's changed, are there restrictions stopping you and how has the experience effected the enjoyment of travel. Referred to as the Airbridge or travel bubble - it is now possible for intra Europe travel. I fly on three different aircraft most interestingly BA's 787 Dreamliner in Business Class & also Iberia's A350 in their Business. \nPossibly the most alarming experience was a completely full flight on Iberia's A320. After months of social distancing, being sandwiched in a plane with many others does make you feel a little uneasy. \nI also show you the arrival experiences by country, including Spain, Belgium, Holland and back in the UK. What forms and processes you have to go through now including if you need to quarantine. \nLastly I look into what it's like to travel on public transport throughout Europe, and how reliability of hotel bookings has been effected. \n\nBritish airways business class\nIberia business class\nBa business class\nIberia A350 \nBA 787 dreamliner\nLockdown travel\nFlying after lockdown\nFull flight \nflight review after lockdown\nboeing 787 dreamliner\nairbus a350\nnew normal",

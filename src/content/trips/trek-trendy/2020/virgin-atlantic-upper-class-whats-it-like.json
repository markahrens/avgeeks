 "description": "I flew Virgin Atlantic in Upper Class on their Dreamliner 787-9 from London Heathrow to Miami. What's it like? Here's my review\n#Virginatlantic #upperclass #businessclass #virginbusinessclass\n\nMy flight reviews are unbiased and provide an honest encounter of what it's like to fly on Virgin Atlantic's business class product. \nFlight time was around 9.5 hours for this trip, during the daytime. It gave me the opportunity to experience their inflight food and drink as well as their flat bed. Furthermore they also have an inflight bar which offers drinks, snacks and made to order food. \n\nLet me know what you think as always below\n\nFollow me on IG: instagram.com/will.luxurytravel/\n\nMusic used:\n\n\"Expectations\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/MiRe-w4QOXQ\nSpotify - https://spoti.fi/2SVDkjS",

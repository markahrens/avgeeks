 "description": "Today we're flying upstairs on the British Airways 747 from Chicago to London in their Business Class. This is one of BA's last flights of which they operated the 747,\n\n #britishairways #747 #businessclass\n\nI've always dreamed of flying upstairs on the 747, when I was a younger I wondered of what it was like up those stairs. Today I'm going to show you exactly what it's like to fly in BA's Business Class, which they call Club World. There are two areas of Business Class on British Airways' 747, downstairs in a 2-4-2 layout or the preferable and far quieter 2-2 upstairs. I will share with you what the seats are like, where is best to sit, the food, drink and what it's like to sleep on. \n\nLet me know what you think below and be sure to subscribe for weekly videos on the channel. \n\nMusic used:\n\n\"Love\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/IeyeXjis-UM\nSpotify - https://spoti.fi/2SVDkjS\n\nBritish Airways 747\n747 last flight\nBA 747 last flight \nBritish airways club world 747\nLast flight of queen of the skies \nLast flight\nBritish airways\nUpstairs on the 747-400\n747-400 BA last flight",

Come along with me to find out what’s changed and if it's still worth flying First Class? This is known as the Emirates Game Changer and you may have seen my experience on this before pre lockdown. Thing's I was most interested to find out, is the service the same, how different is the food and is there still bedding provided?\n\nI also thought it would interesting to fly the world’s best business class to catch the world’s best First Class. Something I’ve not seen before on YouTube… so let’s do something new! My flight today takes me to three different countries on two different airlines, Qatar Airways and Emirates. \n\nExperience the best of Business Class and First Class all in one video. \n\n-----\n\nEmirates First Class\nEmirates Gamechanger First Class\nBest First Class in the World\nQatar QSuites\nEmirates 777 \nQatar 777\nBusiness Class\nFirst Class\nFirst Class Suite\nEmirates Suite",

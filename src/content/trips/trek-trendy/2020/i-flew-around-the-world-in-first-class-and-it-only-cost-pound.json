 "name": "I Flew AROUND the WORLD in FIRST CLASS & it ONLY cost £___",
 "description": "This should have cost me A LOT more! I flew the circumference of the earth in the World’s Best First Class Suites!\n\nIt honestly was one of the most exciting things I’ve ever done. Departing London, stopping off along the way until I landed back in London a month later. Examples being Emirates First Class, British Airways First Class, Japan Airlines First Class, Delta First Class and Asiana! I stopped off along the way visiting friends and experienced as much of each country as possible during my time there. I’ll share with you in the video exactly how I booked this and how much I paid. \n\nMUSIC USED:\nHuge thanks to Temper Beats for the awesome tunes:\n\n“Alone\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/cRB-towrYIs\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/artist/4msU1...\n\n\"Motive\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/Uz_rY_zZGL8\nSpotify - https://spoti.fi/2SVDkjS\n\n\"Focus\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/iTuL-QtU4lY\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/artist/4msU1...\n\n\"Indifferent\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/8ycOrCgFtpo\nSpotify - https://open.spotify.com/artist/4msU1...\n\n\"Rotary\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nhttps://youtu.be/4AA2rpebAJI\n\n\"Anxious\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/TtEWkh0uHxY\nSpotify - https://spoti.fi/2SVDkjS\n\n\"Motive\"\nInstrumental by Temper Beats\nYoutube - https://youtu.be/Uz_rY_zZGL8\nSpotify - https://spoti.fi/2SVDkj\n\nFirst Class around the world\nFlying around the world \nFlying around the world in first class\nAround the world \nFirst Class Emirates \nFirst Class\nEmirates A380 First Class\nNew Emirates First Class\nEmirates First Class gamechanger\nBritish Airways First Class\nJAL First Class\nJapan Airlines First Class\nAsiana Business Class\nDelta First Class\nBusiness class around the world",

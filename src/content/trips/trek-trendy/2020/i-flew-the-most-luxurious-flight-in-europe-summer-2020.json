 "name": "I FLEW the MOST LUXURIOUS FLIGHT in EUROPE *Summer 2020*",
 "description": "What's the best way to fly in Europe at the moment? Business Class, First Class? Unfortunately short haul flights in Europe have an awful reputation. Blocking a middle seat? Or perhaps not even offering any food (no shade honestly Iberia). \n\nToday i've found a contender and it's one of my favourite aircraft the 787 Dreamliner. Yes this is Turkish Airlines brand new Business Class. Compare this to short haul on an A320, 737 etc from the likes of British Airways, Iberia or Lufthansa - they're world's apart. Of course travel at the moment is very different due to various lockdowns and the current situation at hand. So let's find out what this is like, together.\n\nGo follow my friends who you saw in the beginning:\n\nAndy's YouTube: youtube.com/user/wecanfly777\nAnd his IG: wecanfly777\nLinz: flylikelinz\nRoss: arealflyguy\nJarv: theluxurytraveller\n\nBe sure to check out some of my other videos on the channel.

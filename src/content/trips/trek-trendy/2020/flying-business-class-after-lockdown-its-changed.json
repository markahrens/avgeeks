 "description": "What is it like to fly Business Class after lockdown in the UK? What changes are there, and what can we expect to see in the future of air travel?\nFollowing essential work travel I thought it'd get my camera out and take you guys along to document my experience of what it's like to fly British Airways Business Class at present. From empty airports through to the onboard amenities, how has everything changed, especially from a premium travel perspective?\n\nI also explain how I booked this flight using air miles - as cash rates for travel at the moment are through the roof. \n\nMusic used: thanks to Temper Beats as always for their fantastic beats.

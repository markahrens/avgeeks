 "description": "What's it like on the world's largest plane during lockdown? Come with me and experience First and Business Class onboard the huge Airbus A380. \nWe start our journey today in Dubai the home of Emirates. My aim today is to show you what it's like to fly onboard the only carrier operating the A380 at present. With every other airline grounding they A380s Emirates still operates these on key routes such as the London route i'm flying today. \n\nI'm also check out the exclusive shower spa onboard, as well as bar and lounge area. Unfortunately these are closed until further notice but I still was able to check these out. Thanks to the wonderful crew onboard today's flight!\n\n----------\n\nEmirates First Class A380\nEmirates Business Class \nA380 world's largest plane\nAirbus A380 First Class\nEmirates A380 shower\nA380 lounge\nLockdown travel",

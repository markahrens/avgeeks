 "description": "Please like share and subscribe to TrekTrendy for more worldwide travel vlogs: http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nI had the fortune of just a few hours in the beautiful capital city of Hungary, Budapest. In these few hours I picked up my camera and take you along for a trip around the Old Town, riverside on the River Danube, Buda Castle, Buda Terrace and some spectacular views out over the Parliament building. I'd have loved more time, and I will definitely be back in the future to film more. What a lovely city! Hope you enjoy the video guys and see you again, very soon\n\nMusic by \nJoakim Karud http://youtube.com/joakimkarud\nFuture James - Life Could Be A Dream https://soundcloud.com/jamesasilo",

 "description": "Please like share and subscribe to TrekTrendy for more worldwide travel vlogs: http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nThe plane has a bar!\nI had the wonderful opportunity to try Qatar Airways A380 Business Class a few weeks back, and my word what an experience! I was travelling from Bangkok to Doha a flight which takes around 8.5 hours. \n\nHighlights for me were of course the inflight bar which is just huge, the size and comfort of the seats, the service and the White Company pyjamas! Lastly though what really stood out was the food something which Qatar does a stellar job of! Let me know what you think to the video, it sure was fun to film and edit - and i'll be posting many more in the coming weeks. Thanks guys!\n\n-------------\nBackground music credit: \nTropical Love (Original Mix) by Del https://soundcloud.com/del-sound\nCreative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported— CC BY-SA 3.0 \n\nWith thanks to Heythenamesalex for the like and subscribe animation",

A flying visit of course, but I had to explore as much as possible during my layover. Today I'll take you along with me as I explore this gorgeous capital city - albeit the temperatures were far below freezing. I also managed to get some pretty awesome drone shots across the city and will try to include more of these in future videos. \n\nI stayed at the brand new Hilton hotel which is a short walk from the Old Town. This was perfect for me, but there are plenty of other options in the old town which are more convenient. Do let me know what you think as always in the comments, and if there are any places you want me to visit next! \n\nMusic used:\nSong: Joakim Karud - Waves \nhttps://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud Creative Commons â€” Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unportedâ€” CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nSong: Joakim Karud - 10k\nhttps://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud Creative Commons â€” Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unportedâ€” CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nInstagram: @davis.travel",

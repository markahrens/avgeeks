I've been fortunate to explore some amazing countries around the world and I want to summarise the highlights of this with you guys today.\n\nThis doesn't cover the full list of countries i've visited this year and is only a summary, you'll find more videos of my trips this year on the channel.  \n\nMusic used: \nKeep Walking by Rodrigo Vicente https://www.hooksounds.com\nCreative Commons — Attribution 4.0 International — CC BY 4.0",

 "description": "Please like share and subscribe to TrekTrendy for more worldwide travel vlogs: http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nI had the opportunity to visit Kaunas in Lithuania, albeit only for a short amount of time, but I jumped at chance! Kaunas is Lithuania's second largest city, and it's where I started my journey on exploring the country. I arrived late at night on a coach from Warsaw, so woke up early the following day to explore this beautiful city. \n\nUnfortunately both the weather and the attractions were not on our side as a lot were closed due to either holiday/lunch/weather but I was sure to make the most of the time I had. I will definitely be returning in the near future to see more of this great city. Remember to tune in again soon for the Vilnius segment of this trip! \n\nStock video usage:\nPlane landing in wind sourced from videvo and used under Creative Commons 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) - with thanks to the author stockfootage\n\nTown hall Timelapse, sourced on Videvo and used under Creative Commons 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0).

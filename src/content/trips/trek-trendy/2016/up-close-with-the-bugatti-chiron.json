 "name": "UP CLOSE WITH THE BUGATTI CHIRON!",
 "description": "I had the pleasure of seeing the Bugatti Chiron up close and personal at the Geneva Motorshow 2016 last week and wow what a car! This supercar or should I say hypercar really blew all of the other manufactures out of the water! \n\nI've put together a short video to show you around the Bugatti Chiron, I was able to get right up to the car, sadly not inside but I did get quite a nice shot of the interior. This video plays a small part of my Switzerland and Paris trip this month, but was so excited I wanted to share this with you guys as soon as I got back to the UK. \n\nSo the performance. What's the Bugatti Chiron capable of? \n0 - 60 - 2.5 secs...\nTop Speed - 288MPH\nCost - 2 MILLION POUNDS! \n\nHope you like the video! Not the usual travel video I know, but I just couldn't resist sharing this incredible car with you!",

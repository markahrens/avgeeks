 "description": "Please subscribe to TrekTrendy TV : http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nThose of you who are regular to the channel will know I love Dubai! If you're interested in going (or want to go again!) I've put together quite a few videos on the best things to get up to whilst you're here. \n\nYou'll see my take on Dubai Mall, the world's largest, the aquarium, Burj Khalifa the world's tallest building and even a tour of old Dubai including the Gold Souk. \n\nI stayed at the Pullman Deira city centre, which you can check out here: http://bit.ly/2aAZMM2 . You have a rooftop pool, well appointed rooms and one of the best inclusive breakfasts I've ever had in a hotel. Highly recommended. \n\nAs always, I hope you've enjoyed the vlog.

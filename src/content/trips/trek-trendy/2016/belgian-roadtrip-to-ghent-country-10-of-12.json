 "name": "BELGIAN ROADTRIP TO GHENT - Country #10 of 12",
 "description": "In October I took a P&O ferry over to Calais, France. From there I drove over to the beautiful city of Ghent in Belgium. Staying at an Airbnb apartment in the centre of Ghent for 2 nights, perfectly situated to explore the medieval city. I also had a chance to visit Bruges on my return to Calais, indulging in the incredible chocolate and waffles! Make sure you like, subscribe and share!",

 "name": "THE 3IN1 POLISH CITY - Gdansk, Sopot & Gdynia",
 "description": "In January I flew over to Gdansk in Northern Poland for a week to explore the famous tricity, consisting of Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia. I booked a really fantastic airbnb, in the heart of Gdansk, costing just Â£15 a night inclusive of our own private sauna! \n\nNext we travelled over to the seaside part of the tricity, to the resort town of Sopot. Staying at the Mera Spa hotel we enjoyed outside jacuzzi's... yes I know crazy at -7! As an English guy I found the prospect of snow on the beach unbelievable - i'm told this is normal... I also witnessed europe's longest pier, half a km long and built over 100 years ago, quite the stunner! \n\nWe concluded our trip back in Gdansk, staying at the hilton looking over the gorgeous city. Due to the coldness the river was frozen over, which was strange seeing boats frozen in the water. All in all, the trip was awesome, and a really good break away from England. Head over to my website http://www.TrekTrendy.com to see how you can enjoy the same for half the price!",

 "name": "CHAMPAGNE ROADTRIP! - England to Troyes",
 "description": "So you've heard of Troyes? Well I hadn't before this trip, and it's in fact an awesome town in the Champagne region of France. I think what you'll probably find more entertaining is the trouble which I faced with the French toll roads... now not that many people think about this, but being in an English car (right hand drive) all of the tolls are on the left... go figure ;) \n\nI've tried to give a perspective of what it's like to drive over to France, so the P&O ferry experience (which by the way was great!) and driving on the wrong side of the road... you know what I mean... \n\nThis is the first half of my road trip last month, I actually move onto Germany and Luxembourg next (....part 2 coming very soon!).",

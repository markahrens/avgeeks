 "description": "Subscribe to TrekTrendy: http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\nWebsite: http://www.TrekTrendy.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TrekTrendy\n\nI spent the May bank holiday weekend in London this year, and with thanks to a good friend of mine was able to benefit from a close to free stay at the Hilton Bankside near to the Shard/Waterloo in central London. This hotel is usually over £200 a night but thanks to the 10 night stay loyalty which my friend has had with Hotels.com he was able to benefit from an almost free stay here! \n\nCheck out my room tour of the Hilton Bankside, as well as a look at some of their excellent facilities such as the heated basement swimming pool! \n\nI also used a technique to buy cheap train tickets which has not been covered hugely online, buy booking with Megatrain.com. Head over and see for yourself, but I saved 75% off my fare!\n\nAs always if you have any questions about this, or any of my other videos head over to the TrekTrendy website: http://www.TrekTrendy.com\n\nMusic with thank to:\nFog by jimmysquare https://soundcloud.com/jimmysquare\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported— CC BY 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\nMusic provided by Audio Library https://youtu.be/H92srOZDg1M",

 "description": "Please like share and subscribe to TrekTrendy for more worldwide travel vlogs: http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nI had the opportunity to visit Kaliningrad for a long weekend, and my word what a place! It's notoriously quite time consuming from a British perspective to get a Russian visa, but there's an exception for overland travel to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad whereby you can get issues a 72hour tourist visa. I used a recomended Travel agent, Uni-tours.ru for the application who were very helpful and went beyond to help me get my visa. \n\nHope you enjoy the vlog, plenty more upcoming! Comment below if you have anywhere particular you want me to visit! Cheers - Will",

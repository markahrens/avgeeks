 "description": "Please like share and subscribe to TrekTrendy for more worldwide travel vlogs: http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nI was fortunate enough to try out Business Class on British Airways for the first time recently, so thought i'd share my views with you all. I was on my way to Hong Kong for the International Travel Expo, so had close to 12 hours in BA's business class product. \n\nI've heard many mixed reviews of BA's Business Class product. To date i've tried, Virgin Atlantic Upper Class, Qatar Airways First and Business class, LATAM Business Class and Royal Jordanian Business Class, so was really looking forward to comparing the products. \n\nIn all honesty I was very impressed, the soft product with regards to service was solid, the food was brilliantly presented and really tasty! A strong selection of wines and champagne. In terms of the hard product, I got a good nights sleep in BA's flat bed, though do wish they had introduced their duvet which they are rolling out currently across their long haul fleet in business class.",

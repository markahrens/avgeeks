 "description": "Please like share and subscribe to TrekTrendy for more worldwide travel vlogs: http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nOn my way to Bangkok flying out of Hong Kong International airport I was lucky enough to sample the Cathay Pacific Pier Business Class lounge. I only had around an hour in the lounge prior to my flight, but I thought i'd share my experience with you guys! Key things are this is Cathay Pacific's flagship Business Class lounge, and my word what a place! Hope to experience the First Class lounge next time. \n\nAlso I explain the situation which we were faced with, whereby we got given the opportunity to voluntarily downgrade to economy for a cash reimbursement. Hope you like it guys and as always let me know your thoughts in the comments.  \n\nMusic credit: Rock Angel - Joakim Karud",

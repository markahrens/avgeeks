 "description": "Download Opera for free: https://opr.as/82ji-trektrendy\n\nToday i'm taking a luxury cruise for seven days all the way to Whittier, Alaska! I'll show you exactly what it's like to stay in the best suite onboard, what the onboard dining is like plus the facilities such as the Spa, Theatre and the shopping. As usual I've paid in full for this trip myself. \n\nI'll be taking both of my parents on this one! We'll be departing Vancouver and travelling up the inside passage to Juneau, then onto Glacier Bay and finally Whittier, gateway to Anchorage.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n3:00 - Penthouse suite\n12:08 - Ship tour\n16:47 - The Spa\n22:00 - Glacier Bay\n26:47 - The Cost",

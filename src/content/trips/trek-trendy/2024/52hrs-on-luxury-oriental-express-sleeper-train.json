Join me and Dad as we explore this stunning train. From the well appointed ensuite compartments, to the two restaurants onboard and the highlight of course… the outdoor observation car. \n\nI’ll also explain this trains fascinating past, as it’s not always been a sleeper train on this continent! This trip of course did not come cheap, however due to an unforeseen delay on the VSOE last summer, I was able to enjoy this trip for a lot less than you’d think! (I explain fully in the video). \n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:46 - Accommodation \n6:00 - Dining Car \n12:12 - Observation Car\n15:20 - The Cost",

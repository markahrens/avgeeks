I'll show you exactly what i'ts like from the 8 different neighbourhoods onboard, to the luxury suites available (yes I take a look at the ultimate family townhouse!) and some of the 20+ restaurants. \n\nWe'll be taking star class today, so not only do we have almost everything included, but access to the most amazing Royal Genie, Anna.  \n\nHowever as usual, this is fully self funded so be sure to see my brutally honest opinion on everything. Full details on how I booked this and a cost break down are included in the video. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n3:08 - Icon Loft Suite\n11:53 - Thrill Island \n18:10 - Ice Skating\n25:16 - Ultimate Family Townhouse\n31:13 - Aquashow \n33:32 - The Cost",

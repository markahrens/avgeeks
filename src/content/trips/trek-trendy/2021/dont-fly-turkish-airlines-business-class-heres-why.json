 "description": "Why shouldn’t I fly Turkish Business Class at the moment?\n\nI’m never been one to throw about negative reviews - just honest ones. Over the past 6 flights I’ve been on with Turkish, I can’t recommend their business class. From a consumer perspective you just don’t get a proper business class product. You may get the hard product, but the soft product has err gone missing. \n\nNow many will no doubt shout at me here, stating that corona has impacted this. And yes of course it’s impacted airlines all over. But the fact airlines like Emirates, Swiss and Lufthansa can continue to offer similar products to usual times drums this point home. If you significantly cut a product then you should reflect this in the price accordingly. \n\nAnyhow, what do you think?

 "name": "LOW COST LUXURY: The NEW FlyDubai Business Class",
 "description": "Today I’m trying out the new FlyDubai business class on my way to the UAE. I’m really interested to try this product as it’s a totally new airline for me. Given their competitive price point, and stellar looking business product, could this be the best budget business class? \n\nI’m starting out of Bucharest international airport, as unfortunately FlyDubai doesn’t fly to London just yet. I have a rather tight connection after my British Airways flight from LHR so the race is on... or else i'll be having in Romania!\n\nAs in all my trip reports, I’ll be looking at the overall product comparing to the competition. Taking into account the hard and soft product. Most interestingly to me, are that Fly Dubai offers a fully flat bed, which could potentially rival the Emirates Business Class proposition. More so, I’m intrigued to try the food, drink and what amenities will be available. As always let me know what you think down below and what airlines you’d like to see next? \n\nFollow my travels live on IG: https://instagram.com/will.luxurytravel/",

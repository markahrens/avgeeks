After nearly two years grounded, the Airbus A380 returns to the sky. I’m on the very first flight out of London Heathrow, in their First Class and for me, for the first time! I’ll walk you through the complete experience in todays trip report, of what it’s like at the airport as a First Class passenger, and what to expect onboard. From fine dining, to the huge A380 inflight lounge. We’ll look at some of the best bathrooms in the sky, and of course what it’s like to have the entire First Class cabin to myself.\n\nAlso today, I will share some of my exclusive interview with Qatar Airways Group CEO, His Excellency, Mr Akbar Al Baker, where I get to ask him more about the plans for the A380, and why it’s back in the sky. I’ll also take you behind the scenes of Qatar’s catering facility in Doha, so you can see how your inflight food is really made… just a heads up this will make you hungry! \n\nFollow along live with my travels on IG: will.luxurytravel",

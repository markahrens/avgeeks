Click here: http://bit.ly/noom_trektrendy to take your free Noom Evaluation. #noom #noomfluencer \n\nToday Iâ€™m flying onboard Singapore Airlines on their newest route. I'll be trying out their Airbus A350 Business Class, in what I regard as the very best seat onboard, the bulkhead. This is what's known as a fifth freedom flight, between Copenhagen, Denmark and Rome, Italy. \n\nAfter my experience today I have to say I'm overall very impressed with SQ, and it arguably rivals some First Class products out there. The food service was certainly lacking today however, and the ground service in Copenhagen was a shambles to say the least. Thankfully the SAS staff were super helpful, and I'm sure these issues will be ironed out in due course, given that today is the inaugural. This new route does offer a super opportunity for those Europe based on indeed those needing to travel between Denmark and Italy, a chance to try an airline which almost exclusively flies mid / long haul flights. \n\nHave you flown SQ's A350 before?\n\nFollow my travels live on IG: will.luxurytravel",

 "name": "THE PLANE BROKE! Aeroflot Sukhoi Superjet Business Class *Crazy Experience*",
 "description": "Today was not a normal flying experience... \n\nCome and experience what it's like to fly onboard the Russian made Sukhoi Superjet 100 in Business Class. Unfortunately things didn't quite got to plan which resulted in a very different travel day. I begin my day in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport after staying overnight in the airport transit hotel. First we'll check out the Aeroflot Business Class lounge before boarding our flight to Poland. \n\nI'm reviewing Aeroflot's Business Class product today, which happens to offer one of the best soft and hard products in Europe. Seats even on narrow body jets are proper business class, unlike many of the blocked middle's you'll get throughout the rest of the continent. \n\nAs usual on these trip reports, i'll look at all elements of the experience, from boarding, inflight service, food and seat comfort.\n\nFollow me on IG: will.luxurytravel",

 "description": "What happened on my Air Canada Business Class Flight? \n\nI flew on AC's new new 787-9 Dreamliner on red eye flight from Mexico City. I'd be excited to try this airline, as i've never had a chance to before, but unfortunately quite a few things went wrong. Here is my account of what happened. \n\nI was silenced by the crew, told I was not allowed to film, provided a sub par premium experience and made to feel very unwelcome. This is not what I expected from North America's best Airline... \n\nI want to give a special mention to the ground crew which came to check on me in the terminal, to apologise for the experience I had and to offer me food, snacks and Air Canada merch. An excellent example of how to rectify a poor experience, I just hope that mentioned service improvements will happen on this red eye flight. \n\nThankfully I still managed to offer a comprehensive review of this flight, but had I not pushed back or made my concerns public on my IG then I feel this may not have been the case. \n\nNext flight up, I'll be flying onboard their 777-300ER in Business Class, and without giving too much away, it was a completely different experience. Let's hope what happened today is a one off. My other concerns today were with the soft product provided, no bedding for a night flight, breakfast served at midnight and overall attitude towards taking photos (not in line with other reviewers). \n\nI hope also to try their Signature Business Class, their YYZ suites (lounge) - but managed to get a tiny sample on my next flight of what their concierge service is like. \n\nAs always let me know what you think to my flight down below. \n\nFollow my travels: will.luxurytravel",

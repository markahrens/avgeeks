In recent years Qatar offered their First Class suite onboard their A380… but given that these are grounded what does flying First Class with them look like today? Well I’ve come over to Doha Qatar to find out just that. I’ll be taking a look inside the newly reopened and refreshed Al Safwa lounge in Hamad International airport, sample them premium restaurant standard food / beverage as well as indulge in the in lounge spa. Yes there’s a hot tub!\n\nIf this isn’t enough I’ll be driven to my plane in a luxury Audi, privately across the tarmac to my waiting Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I’m also in 1A today, my seat of choice on such configuration. Yes it’s near the galley but given the heavy curtains, and that this is a day flight I’m not bothered. It also means you’ll get served first, which is always a bonus.\n\nAs always I’ll give you a full comprehensive trip report of what it’s like to fly regional First Class with QR and whether it’s something I’d recommend. I hope you enjoy today’s flight review, do let me know what you think in the comments below. \n\nFollow my travels live on IG: https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel\n\nMy gear:\n\nGoPro Hero 8 https://amzn.to/3A6Eu2j\nBattery pack https://amzn.to/3C8t27b\nCannon G7X https://amzn.to/3noKxM9\nGorillaPod https://amzn.to/3z3hwYS\n4TB rugged hardrive: https://amzn.to/3z4zfin\n128GB Microsd https://amzn.to/3C8t27b",

Notoriously difficult to book with miles (in fact only available to book if you’re a top tier elite with Air France’s own Flying Blue frequent flier program). Somehow I’ve ended up onboard today, to showcase to you guys what it’s like. \n\nCome with me and experience the famous La Premiere ground service, Michelin star dining, luxury lounge amenities and even being driven to my plane in a luxury car. This product is only available on Air France’s Boeing 777-300ER and I’m flying this very plane today over to Dubai. The icing on the cake of course is that I have the cabin to myself today, which hopefully means I’ll have the most attentive service…. (Conversely not right, as you’ll see).\n\nAs usual on my trip reports, i'll review it all, from the onboard service, dining, bed/seat and ground service. \n\nFollow along live with my travel on IG: will.luxurytravel",

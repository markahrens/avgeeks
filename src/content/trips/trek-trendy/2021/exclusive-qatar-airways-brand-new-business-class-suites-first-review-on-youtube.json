 "name": "EXCLUSIVE: Qatar Airways BRAND NEW Business Class Suites *First Review on YouTube*",
 "description": "Take an exclusive first look at the never before seen Qatar Airways Suites onboard the 787-9. \n\nWith the first flight just a matter of days ago, come take a first-to-YouTube look at Qatar's newest luxury offering. This is flown solely on their Boeing 787-9's but I hear there are plans to roll this out to the non QSuite A350's and 787-8s, but time will tell. \n\nAs usual I'll provide a full walk through of the experience from the start in Madrid all the way over to Doha, Qatar. What the food service is like, what the bed is like and even a loo review! \n\nSo if you're interested at what Business Class looks like in 2020 on arguably the worlds best business class airline... i've got you, come explore these brand new Suites with me. \n\nFollow my travels live on IG: will.luxurytravel",

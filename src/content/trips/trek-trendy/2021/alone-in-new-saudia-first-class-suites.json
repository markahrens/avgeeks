An airline that many of you won't be familiar with, today I'm finding out what their new First Class Suites are really like. Given that tickets are usually multiple thousands of dollars, it's not been easy to get onboard for this review. Coupled with Saudi Arabia being a notoriously secretive place, with a dislike of filming... it's yet another challenge of todays journey. \n\nI'm starting my flight in Jeddah, in the brand new terminal which has opened just a matter of weeks ago. I'll be checking out their new lounge, overall premium ground service and of course a full trip report encompassing the bed/food/hard product onboard the Boeing 777-300ER, flying to London. \n\nAs always let me know what you think down below, and let me know if you'd fly Saudia Airlines / or if you've flown them before.",

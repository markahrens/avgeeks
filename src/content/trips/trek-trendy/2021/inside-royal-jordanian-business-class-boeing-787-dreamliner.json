I’ll be comprehensively reviewing what their premium cabin is like, their lounge offers & ground service… and importantly whether you should fly them? I’ll be starting my journey in Jordan’s capital Amman, at Queen Alia International Airport after transferring off my Qatar Airways First Class flight from Doha. \n\nI’ll be showcasing the lounge experience which covers a huge upper section of the airport terminal accessible exclusively to Business Class passengers, One World frequent fliers and Priority Pass holders. There’s also the question of given the tight security is, how will I be able to film this trip? \n\nI hope you enjoy today’s trip report, it was a lot of fun to make but do let me know what you think down in the comments below. Would you fly Royal Jordanian, or have you flown them before and you have an experience you want to share? Let me know. \n\nFollow my travels live on IG: https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel\n\n\nMy gear:\n\nGoPro Hero 8 https://amzn.to/3A6Eu2j\nBattery pack https://amzn.to/3C8t27b\nCannon G7X https://amzn.to/3noKxM9\nGorillaPod https://amzn.to/3z3hwYS\n4TB rugged hardrive: https://amzn.to/3z4zfin\n128GB Microsd https://amzn.to/3C8t27b",

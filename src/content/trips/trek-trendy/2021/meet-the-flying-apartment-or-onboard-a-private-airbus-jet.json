 "name": "Meet The Flying Apartment | Onboard a Private Airbus Jet",
 "description": "Join me onboard one of the world’s most luxurious private planes, this is the Comlux Airbus Corporate Jet aka the ACJ319. We’ve been beyond first class before on the channel, and this certainly is up there! On today’s trip report I’ll be exploring the lounge, flight deck, bedroom, private bathroom and shower.. as well as the separate Business Class cabin. \n\nSpecial thanks to Comlux who invited me today to take a look around one of their planes. Head over to their website ( https://comlux.com ) or channel https://www.youtube.com/c/ComluxGroup if you want to learn more about their fleet, one in particular I’m fascinated with is their Boeing Business Jet, 767… the Comlux Skylady. \n\nFollow my travel live: https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel/",

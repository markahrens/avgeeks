After my last flight on their 787-9 in Business Class over from Mexico City, there's certainly a lot of room for improvement. I have a 14 hour layover first to contend with at Toronto international airport. \n\nMy second Air Canada flight will be on their 777-300ER in Business Class. I'm told there should be a number of improvements with their soft product for this routing including some bedding this time! I'll also get to meet the captain and this time I will have no issues filming as Air Canada are aware of this flight. This does make reviewing this impartially a bit difficult as you'll see, service is certainly adapted to account for my presence. However I will say I experienced some of the best cabin crew onboard, a huge contrast to my previous flight. The question remains.... will I fly Air Canada again (interestingly awarded North America's best airline). Let's find out. \n\nFollow along live to my travel on IG: will.luxurytravel",

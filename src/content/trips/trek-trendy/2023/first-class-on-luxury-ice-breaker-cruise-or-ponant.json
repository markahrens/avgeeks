I’ll show you exactly what it’s like onboard from our first class suite over two floors, the dining and facilities such as the spa & blue lagoon pool. This level of indulgence doesn’t come cheap though with prices north of $13,000 dollars, so let’s see if it’s really worth the money. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:05 - Suite tour\n7:02 - Dinner\n11:40 - Ship tour\n16:49 - Hot tub\n20:53 - The Cost",

 "description": "Visit https://sterlingpacific.com/TREKTRENDY and use code 'TREKTRENDY' for $300 off!\n\nToday I’m flying the world's longest Boeing 747 flight in First Class from Seoul all the way to Atlanta USA. With a retail cost of over $8000, in my review I’ll show you exactly what the experience is like. From the lounge offered at the airport, to the onboard experience including the bed, food service and what exactly is upstairs on the Boeing 747? This is an ultra long haul flight, and is actually the world's longest 747 flight at over 15 hours in the sky! As usual I paid in full myself for this flight, full costings are shown in the video. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:55 - First Class Lounge\n6:31 - 747 Tour\n10:33 - The Bed\n13:33 - The Cost",

 "description": "Check out Carl Friedrik's “The Luggage Set” here: https://friedrik.com/0m2\n\nToday I’m taking one of the world’s most luxurious cruises for 5 days across the Caribbean. This is the long awaited Ritz Carlton Yacht, Evrima. Scheduled to launch in 2020, this was pushed back around 8 times until finally last October she was launched. I’ve experienced a few luxury cruises now, but this was different. With far fewer passengers, the level of staffing should be an unparalleled experience onboard.\n\nI'll show you the entire experience from boarding in Florida, touring my suite along with the most luxurious \"Owners Suite\" onboard. We'll check out the dining, explore the marina and fully emerce ourselves in the world of Ritz Carlton. \n\nUnfortunately today’s ultra luxury cruise wasn’t quite as seamless as I’d hoped. In this video I’ll be breaking down exactly what happened and if I think you should try it for yourself. As always, I remain unbiased and honest in my reviews, this is no exception.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:51 - Suite tour\n4:39 - Dinner\n8:00  - Balcony\n11:04 - The Spa\n13:05 - Pools\n18:19 - Marina\n20:24 - The Issues",

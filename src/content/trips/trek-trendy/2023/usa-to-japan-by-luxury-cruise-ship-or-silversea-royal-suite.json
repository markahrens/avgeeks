This is an ultra luxury cruise line, where everything is taken care of from having your own butler, a spacious Royal suite, fine dining and first class service. We’ll travel some 4,000 miles from Seward Alaska, stopping briefly on Kodiak Island, and in Dutch harbour, before passing the international date line. We'll arrive into Tokyo, Japan after 14 days at sea. I’ll show you exactly what it’s like from my Royal Suite, to the various restaurants and facilities onboard. As usual this is self funded, and Silversea had no idea I was coming. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n3:12 - Room tour\n11:43 - Ship tour\n15:58 - Formal dinner\n19:12 - Dutch Harbour \n25:43 - International Date Line \n29:00 - The Cost",

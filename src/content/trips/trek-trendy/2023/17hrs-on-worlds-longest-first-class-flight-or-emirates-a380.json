We’ll depart Dubai and travel for 9,000 miles across the world for 17 hours, to New Zealand, all in one of the most luxurious first Class products in the sky. I’ll share with you exactly what it’s like to fly in Emirates First Class on their A380 including the Shower Spa, inflight lounge & fine dining available. There’s even a new movie menu… which means popcorn in bed!\n\nThis Emirates A380 flight only resumed service a few weeks ago after a pause of service for the last few years. It regains top spot for the world's longest First Class flight and indeed the longest Airbus A380 flight, really pushing the range of the largest commercially available aircraft. There are longer flights, such as the Singapore Airbus A360 ULR to JFK but this only features Business Class. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:26 - First Class lounge\n7:00 - Seat Tour\n10:55 - Shower Spa\n13:58 - Onboard Lounge\n15:54 - New Zealand",

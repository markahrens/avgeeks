With a luxury private, enclosed space it's the perfect environment to relax over a ultra long haul 15 hour flight from Tokyo all the way to New York City. We'll also take a comprehensive look at the other classes of travel, including The Room, ANA's Business Class suite. \n\nAs always i'll review all the product features, from the Japanese dining available, to the inflight entertainment and of course the bed. I'll also show you how I paid for this ticket (as usual i'm self funded, and the airline had no idea I was coming).",

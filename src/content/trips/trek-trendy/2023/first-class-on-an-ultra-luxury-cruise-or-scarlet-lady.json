Join me in the very best suite onboard, dubbed the Mega Rockstar Massive Suite. \n\nAs always I’ll give you a comprehensive review of the experience, from the food on offer, the onboard facilities such as the luxurious spa, the pools & our private hot tub. My aim is to see if this really is the luxury cruise line which it’s been touted as, and if this is a true luxurious experience. I’d also like to benchmark this against other experiences, such as the Orient Express, Rovos Rail or even Queen Mary 2 trips which I’ve taken over the last few months. \n\nI already expect this to be a more informal approach to luxury, but will the best suite onboard live up to expectations. Oh and talking of our suite, this features, a bedroom, living room, Italian marble bathroom, music studio and the largest balcony / terrace you’ve seen at sea. This really is like a floating 5* hotel.  \n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:26 - Our Suite\n7:05 - Dinner\n10:56 - Balcony tour\n14:58 - Lunch\n19:15 - Entertainment\n22:15 - The Bahamas",

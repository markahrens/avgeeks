Having reviewed a wide variety of the world's best First Class products I believe this to be the very best First Class in commercial aviation. Featuring the only fully private rooms, with floor to ceiling doors, a seat designed using NASA tech and an interior inspired by the Mercedes S Class. This is really the pinnacle of flying up front. I'll be comparing this to the other key competitors in this segment, Air France La Premiere and Singapore First Class suites on the Airbus A380. Remember this is a different First Class to the popular A380 First Class suites, which I've reviewed here on the channel previously. This is only found on a handful of Emirates' fleet, and only one select routes such as Brussels, London, Frankfurt and Zurich.\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n1:30 - First Class Lounges\n4:10 - Getting onboard\n6:34 - Suite tour \n8:28 - Lunch time\n11:39 - The Bed\n13:16 - Afternoon Tea",

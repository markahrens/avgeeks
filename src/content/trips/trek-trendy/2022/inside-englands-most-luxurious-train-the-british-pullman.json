I'm taking Millie along today, and we have the best seat available, a first class compartment. Join us as we experience a 5 course menu, tour our luxury cabin as well as the rest of the opulent once in a lifetime train journey. \n\nAs with all my videos i'll show you exactly what you can expect taking this train, how much it cost as well as the various other seats available. Departing London Victoria station, we'll be taking the Golden Age of Travel itinerary all the way over to the British Seaside. One arriving, we'll have drinks on the platform before returning to London later afternoon. \n\nAfter taking the Belmond Venice Simplon Orient Express i've been trying to get onboard this iconic train, partly because in usual times this is the first leg of the journey - but due to external factors it's not been operating for the months of April, May and June.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:39 - Getting onboard\n3:10 - Room Tour\n6:04 - Lunch \n8:42 - The Seaside\n10:06 - Other classes\n13:04 - Back to London",

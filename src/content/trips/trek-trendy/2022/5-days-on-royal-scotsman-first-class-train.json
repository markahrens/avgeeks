Millie & I will spend five days onboard in a private ensuite bedroom, as we explore the beautiful Scottish highlands. Starting in Edinburgh we'll head North towards Inverness and after stable overnight in a siding, continue on to the Isle of Skye. I'll show you exactly what it's like on this once in a lifetime trip... especially given ticket prices are north of $15,000. This is the first fully documented trip available on YouTube, so join us and find out for real what it's like. From two dining rooms, an observation car with the only outside viewing platform in Europe plus a variety of exciting off train activities like seal spotting and exploring a privately owned castle.\n\nThanks to my friend Jarvis, for assisting in all the finer details when booking this trip.

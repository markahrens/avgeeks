Run by the same company as the Venice Simplon Orient Express, the Andean Explorer is a luxury first class train which runs multiple itineraries across the country. Onboard I’ll share with you the various restaurants, the observation deck, piano bar and of course a full room tour - I have the best onboard, the one bedroom suite. And what’s more, onboard there’s something I’ve never even heard of being on a train before… a fully functional spa! \n\nAs always I’ll give you a full breakdown of what it’s like to take one of the best luxury trains, the cost and my honest opinion on whether you should do the same. So come join me on a luxurious, first class adventure across South America. \n\n0:00 - Introduction\n1:48 - Getting on the train\n3:08 - Suite tour\n6:38 - The Spa\n10:00 - The Bed\n14:28 - Observation Deck\n18:01 - Highest train station\n21:43 - Arrival",

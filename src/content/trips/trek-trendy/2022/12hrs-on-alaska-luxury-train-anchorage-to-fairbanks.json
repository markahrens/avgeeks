The trip will take around 12 hours, and travel along one of the world’s most beautiful railroads. Join me as I show you around the Goldstar carriage, with glassed domed roof, comfy recliner seats, restaurant and my personal favourite… the outdoor viewing deck. \n\nWhat’s more i'll show you around other areas of the train, in what’s called adventure class. Here we’ll try the cafe and explore the infamous dome car offering a unique perspective of both the train and surroundings. I’ll also discuss pricing and overall what you can expect on this service. \n\n0:00 - Introduction\n2:18 - Getting onboard\n3:43 - Breakfast\n5:16 - Seat Tour\n6:50 - Viewing Deck\n8:26 - The locomotive \n12:13 - Denali\n13:00 - Adventure Class\n15:25 - Dinner\n16:20 - The Cost",

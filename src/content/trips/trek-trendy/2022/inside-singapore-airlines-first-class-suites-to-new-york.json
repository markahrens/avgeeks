It’s really in a class of it’s own, and by SQ’s own admission, it’s beyond First Class (I reviewed their Boeing 777 earlier this year). As with all my trip reports, I’ll take you through each step of the journey. From check in, the lounge offers and then onboard. What the food is like, and of course the bed! In fact there are two bed options today on the A380, a single or double! \n\nAs always I’ll give you my honest opinion to what it’s like to fly in one of the most luxurious flights within commercial aviation. \n\n0:00 - Introduction \n0:45 - Check In\n2:06 - The lounge\n4:16 - Getting Onboard\n6:40 - Dinner\n9:02 - The bathroom\n10:04 - The Bed\n12:44 - Landing",

 "name": "INSIDE Lufthansa First Class on the Boeing 747",
 "description": "Join me inside Lufthansa's First Class onboard their Boeing 747. Starting at the airport, in a private luxury terminal. Next i'm driven over to the Queen of the Skies in a high performance Porsche. Whilst onboard I'll enjoy caviar, a medium rare steak and a special German desert of Gingerbread. After putting my PJs on (complete with a scarf!) i'll settle into the 5* bed arriving refreshed into the United States. \n\nAs with all my trip reports, you can expect a fully comprehensive review of all elements of the First Class experience. I'll showcase what it's really like to fly this exclusive product from Frankfurt, Germany over to Chicago in the USA.",

This will be quite the experience travelling from Helsinki central station all the way to the Rovaniemi in the Arctic Circle. I'll not only show my ensuite bedroom but also show you what Coach is like and my thoughts on whether I could do an overnight train in a recliner! I'll explore all elements of the onboard service, from dinner in the dining car, to breakfast and what the different carriages are like (such as bikes & pets!). \n\n0:00 - Starting our Journey\n1:28 - Getting onboard\n3:00 - The Dining Car \n5:25 - Bedroom Tour \n9:07 - Day 2 Lapland\n10:44 - Breakfast \n12:04 - Coach Tour\n15:19 - Welcome to Arctic Circle",

This is not only the world’s most iconic, but arguably the most luxurious sleeper train. I have the grand suite today, which features an ensuite bathroom with shower, living space, dining table and double bed. There are three restaurants onboard and even a lounge car with baby grand piano. It’s like the very best 5* hotel on the rails. \n\nBelmond runs all kinds of trains, but this one has been on my list for a long time. I feel incredibly fortunate I was able to get an upgrade to a suite which I’d never in a million years get the chance to travel in with cash. So how did I book this?\n\nAs discussed in the video, I used my friend Jarvis’ luxury travel agency: https://theluxurytraveller.com to book this trip. He assisted no end in arranging all the finer details of the trip and in getting the my space available upgrade to the Grand Suite. \n\n0:00 - Introduction\n1:20 - Getting Onboard\n3:28 - Grand Suite Tour\n6:49 - Dinner\n10:07 - Lounge Car\n12:18 - Switzerland\n15:31 - Lunch in Italy \n21:21 - Other rooms",

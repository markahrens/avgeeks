 "description": "Head to https://squarespace.com/trektrendy to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain using code TREKTRENDY\n\nJoin me on one of the worst flights I've taken to date, Iberia's Airbus A330 in Business Class. There was little premium about today's experience, the cabin cleanliness was shocking, the inflight food was lacking and in part inedible and given the price point of this flight - it offers poor value for money. \n\nAs always I offer a brutally honest review of what it's like to fly in the pointy end, so you can expect a comprehensive review of the Business Class lounge at Chicago airport, along with a seat tour, food & beverage walkthrough and that all important \"bed\" rating. As always do let me know what you think, and also what your experience of Iberia has been to date? Was this just them on a really bad day, or this actually a more common occurrence?",

This is an airline which has proud Yugoslav roots in the old JAT airline (remember them?). \n\nSerbia is a proud nation and their national carrier even flies to New York five times a week, with a single A330. On this short flight, I had a basic economy ticket and travelled on a humble ATR72 to make the 210 mile trip to Zagreb, one of Europe‚Äôs most underrated cities. \n\nI recommend travelling to the Balkans if you can. Since the breakup of the former Yugoslavia the region is peppered with distinct and beautiful nations like Serbia and Croatia, and they‚Äôre well worth checking out. However you might want to avoid the thunderstorms in spring, as you can see in the video!\n\nOverall a perfectly acceptable short hop with Air Serbia and while there was no catering on my bargain basement ticket, the price was alright considering they have a monopoly on this air route. \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips. I‚Äôve started using it properly now and it would be great to see some of you there too. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

In this video I take a teeny tiny trip between Las Palmas in Gran Canaria across to the next island in the Canaries, Fuerteventura. I travel with Air Europa Express on one of their ATR 72 aircraft. \n\nThere‚Äôs not too much to remark on with such a short flight, but one thing which is a bit strange is the fact they played music in the cabin during landing. I‚Äôve experienced that only once before and I‚Äôm struggling to think which airline it was!\n\nNext trip report is on Sunday (of course) and features my long-awaited Thomas Cook Economy Plus trip between Fuerteventura and Birmingham. \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

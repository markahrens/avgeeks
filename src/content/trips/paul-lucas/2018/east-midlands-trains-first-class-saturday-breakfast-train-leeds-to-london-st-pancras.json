On a Saturday, it‚Äôs possible to take the single morning departure at 0634 and head slowly to London via Sheffield and Nottingham. There‚Äôs also a full English breakfast served at your seat. \n\nThis trip cost me around ¬£30, and although I have a railcard giving me a discount, if you book far enough in advance you too can avail of such a cheap fare, even if you don‚Äôt have a railcard. \n\nMost British train operators don‚Äôt offer a proper service in first class at the weekend but thankfully EMT do. It‚Äôs a fine service although it doesn‚Äôt have the polish of other trains like the GWR Pullman (have you seen my video on that yet?). \n\nOverall though the very poor ride quality made eating and drinking more difficult than it should have been - a real disappointment. Plus, a hen party were upgraded for free into my carriage (they were friends of the guard...) and this spoiled the otherwise peaceful ambience of the second half of journey. Oh well!\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

This is my first video posed using my new camera, a Panasonic Linux DMC-LX15. Previously, night flights were almost not worth filming as my iPhone wasn‚Äôt able to deliver acceptable image quality. So this is a mainly experimental trip report; I‚Äôm testing out the capabilities of the camera here, and just seeing what it can do. \n\nI‚Äôve no idea why the Business Class Upgrade was given to me. The flight wasn‚Äôt full and I don‚Äôt have any sort of status with CSA. You‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs only one row of Business: me and one other passenger. However the curtain divider only goes forward as far as Row 2, so strangely there was a row of economy class in the ‚Äúmini cabin‚Äù with us. \n\nAlso really surprising that our flight, at 2105, was the last of the evening. Birmingham is a reasonably busy airport and I would have expected flights to run a lot later than that!\n\nOverall, a decent flight with a meal. It‚Äôs always good to have a gin and tonic in the air!\n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

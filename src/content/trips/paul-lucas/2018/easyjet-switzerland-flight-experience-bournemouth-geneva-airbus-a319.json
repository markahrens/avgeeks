No hold baggage included. \n\nThanks for finding my video and pressing play!\n\nWe‚Äôre lucky in Britain to have a surprisingly large number of active regional airports offering flights to various places. As part of my unofficial quest to travel from as many of them as possible, I travelled from Bournemouth (formerly Hurn) to Geneva. \n\nEasyjet Switzerland is a Swiss franchise of the popular easyJet brand. It can trace its roots back to the old TEA group of airlines. Today, easyJet holds 49% of their Swiss franchise with a variety of private investors making up the rest. \n\nThe report is self explanatory, but I have to say how surprised I was that easyJet offer inflight entertainment (but no WiFi) on this route. They‚Äôre ahead of a lot of legacy airlines - BA are you watching? Despite a delay caused by weather in Geneva this was a great experience and well worth the very modest expense of ¬£43 plus ¬£3 seating fee. \n\nAs a minor point, the flight was basically fully loaded as the Saturday rotation was cancelled due to weather, and some passengers had been rebooked. It was almost exclusively ski traffic and people heading to the Geneva motor show. \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

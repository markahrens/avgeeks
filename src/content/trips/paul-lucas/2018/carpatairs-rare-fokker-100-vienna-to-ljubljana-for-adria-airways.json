The worst one was being denied my first Sukhoi Superjet from Stockholm-Bromma. But sometimes you just get lucky. \n\nI‚Äôd booked this flight as a plain old Adria Airways regional flight on a CRJ900, and it was only on the day of the flight that Adria changed this for a chartered Fokker 100. The full itinerary took me onward to Zagreb. For some shorter connections from Ljubljana, Adria doesn‚Äôt run flights but instead runs minibuses connecting passengers into the city centres. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever taken a bus disguised as a flight before, and you‚Äôll see in the video there‚Äôs a strange anomaly with air miles about this trip!\n\nUnfortunately travelling in winter does mean I take my fair share of night flights (its impossible to make all my itineraries ‚Äúwork‚Äù over a weekend without them). So, there‚Äôs really nothing to see on the ground...but that‚Äôs okay because I got to fly on an unusual aircraft type. Fokker 100s are increasingly rare to find in passenger service in Europe; I was delighted to find this old bird dragged away from her base in Romania to take me on the short hop into Slovenia. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

In this video I travel between Zagreb and Split on a wholly domestic flight within Croatia. \n\nZagreb Airport, which we‚Äôve seen a few times before on my channel, is a lovely new building and everything a small international airport should be. It‚Äôs airy and spacious and there‚Äôs lots of glass allowing for good runway views. \n\nOur flight today also passes over somewhere else I must visit in the near future: Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Balkans have always interested me, as when I was growing up the wars there were the first wars I remember being televised (yes I‚Äôm too young to remember Gulf War I!). It‚Äôs great to visit the area and find how progressive all the nations are now. Croatia is particularly lovely. \n\nAs you know I have an irrational hatred of Q400 aircraft and forgot that the first row has a badly placed window...so I don‚Äôt recommend sitting in 2D! My arm was a little sore from holding the camera there...\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips. I‚Äôve started using it properly now and it would be great to see some of you there too. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

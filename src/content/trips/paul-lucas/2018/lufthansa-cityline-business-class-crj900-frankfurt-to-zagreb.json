The route for this flights takes us over the Swiss Alps, so despite the weather being mostly cloudy, we‚Äôre still treated to a wonderful view of the wintry Alps from 32,000 feet. \n\nThat kind of view is definitely the reason I love flying so much. Lufthansa are a pretty straightforward carrier who deliver what they promise in an unfussy way. I like that about them - they‚Äôre reliable and easy to get along with. However, I wish they‚Äôd tell me what food they‚Äôre serving me...I‚Äôve literally *no idea* what the meal in this video was, other than it had some prawns and beef I think. Very tasty, but if someone can tell me what it was, I‚Äôd be grateful!\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips. I‚Äôve started using it properly now and it would be great to see some of you there too. \n\nLet me know what you think of Lufthansa CityLine in the comments. I have some interesting flights to take in the next few weeks, including (much-requested) Thomas Cook from Fuerteventura to Birmingham, a Canary Islands inter-island hopper, and a spin on Luxair, Luxembourg‚Äôs neat little national carrier. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

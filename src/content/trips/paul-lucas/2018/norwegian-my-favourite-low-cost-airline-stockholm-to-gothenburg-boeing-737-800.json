I‚Äôve flown with them a few times now and the thing that impressed me most is the simplicity of their services. Nothing is difficult to use, they‚Äôre always affordable, and the inflight connectivity is the best I‚Äôve experienced inside Europe. \n\nThis flight was cheaper than the equivalent train journey and, when you factor in getting to and from the airports at either end, around the same time. It also helped that the following day I needed to be at Gothenburg airport very early, to catch the BRA flight featured in this trip report! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=06ozZHHGLcw\n\nIn all, a perfectly simple and good value experience again from Norwegian. The flight was punctual despite some bad weather around Sweden, and the whole experience was efficient and easy. \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

For a short time, LOT is ‚Äúproving‚Äù its new aircraft on the London route from Warsaw. So, naturally, I wanted to go and check out a MAX and find out what all the fuss is about. \n\nLOT is one of the oldest airlines still operating in the world today (founded 1929) and I‚Äôve flown with them about half a dozen times before. They‚Äôre cheap but pleasant to fly with, and in this video I try their European business class. \n\nBusiness class within Europe is rarely anything spectacular, but I know a lot of commenters get hung up on the seats - the same as economy, with a blocked middle seat and usually a drop down table to share. Many people might point to the USA as a place where business class on flights of this length is better because the seat is. I don‚Äôt agree! In this video, I get access to the Singapore Airlines Lounge where I can get a proper cooked breakfast - it‚Äôs definitely several ranks higher than something like an Admirals‚Äô Club, and remember that domestic business and first class within the USA doesn‚Äôt grant you lounge access anyway in and of itself. On most flights of 2h30 or under, you won‚Äôt get fed a proper meal in the USA. It‚Äôs just snacks and drinks. I get an impressive brunch thrown in here courtesy of LOT. It‚Äôs well-portioned and the quality was very good. I‚Äôd go so far as to say on the basis of this meal alone, LOT probably ranks in the top third of European business classes. \n\nThe Boeing Sky cabin on our aircraft is excellent - I really like the mood lighting and the use of soft shapes. Not only is the cabin bright and airy, it‚Äôs also very quiet. Just check out the takeoff footage to see how little noise from outside gets in. \n\nOverall, a first-rate experience for travelling within Europe and I can definitely recommend it. I can also recommend Poland as a weekend destination; it‚Äôs a very underrated country, inexpensive and intriguing. It also has a large number of top-rank hotel rooms available for very little money, plus the Poles have probably the finest hospitality and service culture in Europe. At least, I think so. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

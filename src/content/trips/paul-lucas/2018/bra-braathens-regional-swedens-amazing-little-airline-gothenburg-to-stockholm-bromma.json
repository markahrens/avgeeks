I found out they were BRA Braathens Regional Airlines, a small domestic carrier operating mostly within Sweden from their hub at Bromma. \n\nSo, naturally, I had to try them. At around ¬£100 one way this was by no means a cheap flight. These Gothenburg to Stockholm shuttles are meant for the business traveller and priced accordingly. The flight was full of people off to do a day‚Äôs business in Sweden‚Äôs capital. \n\nHowever, even given the price, I was still impressed by their service standard. This is an airline that knows who its customers are and the product is sensible and thoughtful. There‚Äôs even a breakfast served on the flight, a coffee and drinks service, a hot towel and a second drinks run. Very impressive on a flight of under an hour. \n\nOf course, the real highlight for me was an opportunity to fly one of these old RJ aircraft again. I can remember when they were the staple of BA Cityflyer flights from London City back when I was starting my flying addiction. They‚Äôre a fun aircraft to fly. A bit cramped, but their uniqueness ensures charm overrides pragmatism for me. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

I travelled up to Belgrade, Serbia with them and was on a basic economy fare. \n\nOverall, Aegean offers great value across both cabins. This trip was not at all expensive and came with a free breakfast roll, juice and coffee even on this short 500-mike sector. While the food is never going to be great quality in economy, it‚Äôs more than most legacy airlines in Europe offer and certainly places Aegean towards the top end of the value scale. \n\nThere are even boiled sweets handed out in economy! Last time I remember that was travelling with Air 2000 back in the late 1990s...remember them??\n\nNext up, Air Serbia ATR 72 between Belgrade and Zagreb, featuring a rather nasty thunderstorm where we were lucky to avoid being hot by lightning! \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

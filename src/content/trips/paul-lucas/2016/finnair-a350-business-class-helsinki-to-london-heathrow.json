 "description": "Snapchat: pauls_trips\n\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\n\nBusiness class on the Finnair A350! \n\nIf you’ve browsed my channel uploads then you’ll know the very FIRST video I ever made for YouTube was a trip on Finnair’s A350 on its inaugural flight between Helsinki and London Heathrow.\n\nFinnair occasionally roster this aircraft on the London route because of the demand for cargo space. With such a big business class cabin, reward availability is always good! This flight is unmissable thanks to the fabulous business cabin, featuring a semi-private suite, flat bed and huge windows. This aircraft has definitely been a game changer for Finnair.\n\nJoin me for the whole trip – including the Premium Finnair Lounge at Helsinki, boarding, taxi, takeoff, breakfast, cruise and landing at a blustery and cold London Heathrow. \n\nI absolutely recommend Finland and Helsinki, especially if you can get there by A350 – I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nThat other A350 video I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot2GL4oniRs",

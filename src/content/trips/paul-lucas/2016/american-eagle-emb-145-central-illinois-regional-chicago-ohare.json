 "description": "In this video I take a very short feeder flight between Bloomington-Normal (Central Illinois Regional) and Chicago O'Hare airports.\n\nWe travel on an American Eagle Embraer 145LR in seat 17A. The video features a spectacular takeoff and immediate left turn - quite an experience in the little Embraer! There are also some views of Chicago Downtown as well as some scenic highlights over Northern Illinois.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video - and please do leave a comment if you liked it!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",

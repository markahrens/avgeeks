 "description": "Twitter: @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips\n\nIn this video, I take the Belfast-London shuttle from Belfast City Airport.\n\nThis is a great flight - City airport (formerly Harbour Airport) is only a few miles from Belfast city centre, in the Sydenham district. Much more convenient than the International airport at Aldergrove!\n\nEnjoy the flight!",

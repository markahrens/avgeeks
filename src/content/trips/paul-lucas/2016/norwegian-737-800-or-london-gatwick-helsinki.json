 "description": "Twitter: @pauls_trips\nSnapchat: pauls_trips\n\nIn this video, I fly with Norwegian on one of their 737-800 aircraft between London Gatwick (South) and Helsinki Vantaa Airport.\n\nNorwegian are an expanding budget carrier and this was my first experience with them. I’d definitely use them again. They have WiFi on board which is more than can be said for quite a few carriers in Europe (including British Airways). Overall, a great trip, though it was a little cold and dark in Finland!\n\nI hope you enjoy the video. Leave me a comment – and subscribe!",

 "name": "British Airways Business Class - Club Europe, Airbus A319, Jersey to London Gatwick",
 "description": "This is the shortest Club Europe flight around! Here, I fly between Jersey and London Gatwick. A little under 35 minutes in the air thanks to a fair tailwind up the Channel. I'm still amazed they can serve drinks, a salad lunch, and another drink before landing.\n\n(Note: the video is quite a few months old, and the \"temporary\" lounge in the video is no more. The proper lounge has finished its refurbishment)\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\n\nSnapChat: pauls_trips",

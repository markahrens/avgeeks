 "description": "An outstanding flight with British Airways! We travel from Los Angeles, California, to London, UK. We do so on one of British Airways' fabulous A380 aircraft in First Class, seat 1A (the best in the house, at least I think so anyway!).\n\nYou'll see inside the splendid OneWorld First Class Lounge at LAX, plus a full walkround and video of the dinner service. Boarding, takeoff, landing, cruise...this video covers it all. There's even a second dinner onboard courtesy of British Airways' dine on demand service in First.\n\nI really hope you enjoy the video. Don't forget to subscribe!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",

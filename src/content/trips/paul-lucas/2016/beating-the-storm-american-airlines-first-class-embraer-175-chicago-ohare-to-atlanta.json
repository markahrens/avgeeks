 "name": "BEATING THE STORM! American Airlines First Class, Embraer 175, Chicago O'Hare to Atlanta",
 "description": "Watch our little Embraer regional jet beat a terrific thunderstorm over Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. We're the last plane in before the storm engulfs the airfield. Rather lucky!\n\nThis video features all of the usual highlights - lounge, boarding, takeoff, landing and all the service points in between. I also point out some geographic features along the route. Enjoy the video, and leave me a comment!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",

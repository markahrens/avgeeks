 "description": "25 MINUTES! That's all it took for me to fly the 61 miles, in a big S-bend across Wisconsin and Illinois on this American Eagle flight between Milwaukee General Mitchell and Chicago O'Hare. \n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\n\nSnapChat: pauls_trips\n\nThey still manage to hand out water on this flight too.\n\nEnjoy a beautiful winter morning trip across this lovely part of the frozen Midwest USA. Sightseeing tidbits included as standard, as are all phases of the flight.",

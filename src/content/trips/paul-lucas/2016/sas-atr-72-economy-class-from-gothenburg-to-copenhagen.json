 "description": "In this video, join me on a 55 minute flight between Gothenburg Landvetter, Sweden and Copenhagen Kastrup, Denmark. This was my first flight with SAS and I was impressed.\n\nI really liked their lounge concept, which you will see towards the start of the video.\n\nThe flight was operated by a Jet Time ATR 72, my favourite short haul prop aircraft. Enjoy the video, leave a comment and SUBSCRIBE! Thank you!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",

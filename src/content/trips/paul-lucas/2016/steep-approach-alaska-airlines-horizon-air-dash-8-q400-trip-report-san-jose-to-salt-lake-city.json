 "name": "STEEP APPROACH! Alaska Airlines (Horizon Air) Dash 8 Q400 trip report, San Jose to Salt Lake City",
 "description": "Welcome to another trip report. \n\nWatch the superb steep approach capabilities of the Q400 as we take an unusual route into SLC from SJC. We fly over desert most of the way, with airports and places enroute being pointed out as we fly.\n\nThis was an incredibly cheap flight at around $60 - great value for a 1h55 trip. While the Dash 8 Q400 is one of my least favourite aircraft, Alaska provide a good service (through their partner Horizon). There was even a free beer! Excellent.\n\nI hope you like the video, and please leave a comment and subscribe!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",

 "description": "A beautiful evening flight from AA's Midwest Hub at O'Hare down to Dallas Fort Worth. This particular rotation uses a Boeing 777-200.\n\nThe 777-200s are in the process of being converted from having an International First Class cabin to having the new business class product. However, there are still a few knocking about with the old style First seats. \n\nThis cabin was definitely in need of ripping out, but you can't beat a huge armchair, personal TV and personal office on a two-hour flight! Enjoy the video - a bit of a trip back in time...\n\nSubscribe and comment guys!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",

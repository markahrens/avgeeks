 "description": "Fly with me to City of Derry Airport in Northern Ireland, on a Ryanair 737-800 from Stansted. \n\nRyanair are the only carrier to serve Derry, and fares are low. This was booked for Â£10.99 all in; no bag in the hold and it would have been even cheaper had I not wanted to pick a window seat!\n\nI take the early departure, on a crisp autumn morning. Enjoy the report, and don't forget to subscribe!\n\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\nSnapChat: pauls_trips",

 "description": "In this trip I take a fantastic short flight between Las Vegas and Phoenix Shy Harbor. The trip starts with a spectacular takeoff alongside the Vegas Strip, before turning south-east and tracking the Grand Canyon and Colorado River at an altitude of just 19,000 feet. Finally, we approach Phoenix from the west, flying very close to downtown and Chase Field. \n\nA beautiful winter's day for flying here, and the video includes all of the usual pointers with the service and local geography.\n\nEnjoy the video!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\n\nSnapChat: pauls_trips",

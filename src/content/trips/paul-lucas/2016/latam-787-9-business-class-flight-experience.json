 "name": "LATAM 787-9 Business Class Flight Experience",
 "description": "Wow! This trip blew me away! I think this may be one of the best value flights I've ever taken. LATAM (formerly known as LAN) operate a 787-9 on the Santiago-Madrid-Frankfurt route. I join the flight on its last leg between Madrid and Frankfurt. \n\nThe cost? A little over Â£85 one way. An absolute steal! I love widebody aircraft on short haul routes - just for the novelty, but I'd heard good things about LATAM. My expectations were definitely met. \n\nEnjoy a sublime flight in a Premium Business class seat, a light meal, beverage service and super views from the large 787 windows all the way. \n\nDon't forget to comment, like, and subscribe! Thanks for watching.\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",

 "description": "A really brief stop in the AA Flagship Lounge here!\n\nAccessed by travelling in international First Class or by holding OneWorld Emerald status.\n\nThis is a weak lounge if ambience is your thing. But, if you like a decent Eggs Benedict, stop by (if you qualify...).\n\nEnjoy the video, and why not compare it to the - much better -BA sister lounge? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekwfQ-NpgMc\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\n\nSnapChat: pauls_trips",

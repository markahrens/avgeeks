 "description": "Snapchat: pauls_trips\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\n\nIn this video, I travel on Britanny Ferries' flagship, the MV Pont Aven, between Portsmouth and Santander. Enjoy a complete walkthrough of the whole experience, right in the middle of low season. The ship was less than a quarter full, so there was plenty of room...\n\nThis is marketed as a cruise ferry. We ended up in our own 4 berth cabin....this is a 24hr sailing so I definitely recommend getting a cabin!\n\nEnjoy the video. Don't forget to subscribe!",

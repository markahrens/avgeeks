 "name": "American Airlines 767 Business Class... on a domestic First Class route! Chicago to Miami",
 "description": "Always check the seat plans before booking! AA run some 767-300 aircraft, which have the new international cabins, on domestic routes. Here, we travel from Chicago O'Hare to Miami in First Class.\n\nIn reality, this trip takes place in the International Business cabin - a definite upgrade! The seats lie flat, and there are private single seats next to the windows. This was an early breakfast flight after a red-eye connection so the flat seats were a real boon.\n\nWatch all phases of the flight, lounge and shower details at the Admirals' Club, food service, takeoff and landing. There's even a shot of Donald Trump's golf resort in Miami as we land...\n\nLeave me a comment - and subscribe!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",

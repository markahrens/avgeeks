 "description": "Welcome to another slightly unusual trip. \n\nJet Time are a Danish charter operator. BA had a fleet shortage and hired in this aircraft to cover some of their short haul flights. So, the aircraft is a Jet Time one - as were the crew, but the product was definitely BA all the way!\n\nEnjoy this short report on an unusual aircraft - not often you get to see a 737-700 parked at Heathrow T5!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",

I travelled on this trip back in September (as you can probably tell from the weather!) and finally got around to editing it. \n\nEast Midlands Trains offer some of the best value first class fares in the whole country. This trip took just over two hours and cost just ¬£16.50 (that‚Äôs with a third off thanks to my railcard), fantastic value. These cheap fares can only usually be found in the middle of the day, outside the peak. So what better way to travel to London than in first class?\n\nThere is a lunch menu on board East Midlands Trains. Link to the PDF here: https://www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk/Documents/Menus/1/EMT%20All%20Day%20Menu%20Web%20Friendly.pdf\n\nSo join me as I travel on a 125mph-capable Class 222 Meridian train and race south down one of Britain‚Äôs perhaps lesser known main lines. \n\nFor those of you wanting to see more train trips...I have another one coming out in the next week or so, Plus I‚Äôve got plans to film something great - and a bit different - in January. \n\nI have lots of videos coming out, including in midweek in the run up to New Year. Make sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

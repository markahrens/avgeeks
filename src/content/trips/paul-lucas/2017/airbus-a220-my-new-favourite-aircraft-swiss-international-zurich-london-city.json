I wasn‚Äôt really sure I‚Äôd like it. I don‚Äôt like any other Bombardier aircraft - I find the CRJ series natty and poorly built and I have an aversion to the Dash 8 which is an aircraft that‚Äôs never really inspired my confidence. \n\nBut the C-Series is different. It‚Äôs a wonderful, airy, pleasant ambience. And not to mention quiet. This was a perfect winter midday flight. Glassy smooth with good views from the large and nicely shaped windows. It was one of those flights that made me happy to be alive, just cruising around in the blue sky in a shiny new aircraft. \n\nBuild quality in the aircraft felt solid. Everything got a little pull or a knock from me to check it was nicely built. I liked the tray table apparatus which secures your tray from being moved when the person in front reclines. That‚Äôs thoughtful. I also really appreciate the extra width the cabin offers over the Embraer regional jets (which are excellent, EXCELLENT aircraft by the way). \n\nI very much hope the C-Series is a commercial success. It‚Äôs a simple but impressive piece of kit...and of course, it operates into my favourite UK airport - London City. \n\nI have lots of videos coming out, including in midweek in the run up to New Year. Make sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

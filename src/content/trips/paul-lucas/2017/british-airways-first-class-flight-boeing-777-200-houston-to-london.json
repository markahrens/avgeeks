My return fare (Stockholm-London-Houston and return) cost a shade under ¬£1000, in business class - I upgraded into First using Avios. \n\nThis will be the last in a series of videos featuring BA First Class. That said, my flight was very pleasant, despite the obvious corner-cutting now endemic at British Airways. I‚Äôve just spent the last of my Avios on a Cathay Pacific First Class ultra long haul between Hong Kong and JFK, and that will mark the end of my relationship with BA and Avios. \n\nGoing forward there will be a lot more focus on non-aligned and unusual airlines. \n\nIn this video though, enjoy the simple pleasure of travelling smoothly and calmly across the Atlantic, with three course meals and a flat bed. \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

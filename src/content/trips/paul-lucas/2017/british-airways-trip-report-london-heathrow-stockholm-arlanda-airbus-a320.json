JetBlue Mint, Amtrak Empire Builder, another First Class video, a sweet SouthWest experience...and more. But while I make the finishing touches to those, join me as I travel to Stockholm in Sweden. Next week I'll be posting FLL-LAX with Jetblue's splendid value Mint business class. \n\nI travelled here to start my journey to the United States. Why? Low fares, of course (search \"ex EU\" on Flyertalk if you're still confused). This is just one of the last BA short hauls that will appear on my channel as I've booked upcoming travel with (drum roll) Star Alliance as my chosen alliance for 2018 and beyond. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

I really enjoyed this brief journey, of just over two hours. We travel from London Euston station and head for Liverpool Lime Street. City centre to city centre, it‚Äôs 2h12 minutes of pleasant scenery and tasty food, with breakfast served to my seat. \n\nVirgin provide good value for money on this route. My ticket cost around ¬£30 and included lounge access, free WiFi, onboard entertainment, and a cooked breakfast and beverages. Not bad. Of course, you have to book ahead to get the best deals!\n\nNext UK train trip will be uploaded in 4 weeks‚Äô time - it‚Äôll be a belter, the GWR Pullman. Until then, I‚Äôve got three air trips to publish.\n\nThe signalling maps featured can be found here: http://www.opentraintimes.com/maps\n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

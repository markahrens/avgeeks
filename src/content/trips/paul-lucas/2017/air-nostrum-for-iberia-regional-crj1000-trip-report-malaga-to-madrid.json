I fell victim to this on this flight and had to crane my hand to film out of the window...occupational hazard I guess. \n\nThis is a short flight on a regional jet - a CRJ1000 - from Malaga to Madrid. It was scorching that day, and in case you‚Äôre wondering why I‚Äôm introducing the video wearing a jacket, it‚Äôs because the air con at Malaga airport was turned right up to 11!\n\nThe gap between so called full service airlines and budget carriers gets ever narrower. Nothing came free on this flight despite being a top tier Oneworld Emerald member. My view is reinforced that status is a game the customer doesn‚Äôt usually win and that‚Äôs partly why I‚Äôm stepping out of that game to fly with whoever I fancy. Lounge access was welcome - though I could have got in using my Priority Pass as well!\n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

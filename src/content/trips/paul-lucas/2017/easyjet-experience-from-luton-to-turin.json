Luton Airport is currently undergoing massive redevelopment at the moment, so the place looks like a building site…and feels like one too!\n\nNo lounge on this visit (I’m not buying a PriorityPass until May), but this was a straightforward trip – it would have helped if they’d opened the aircraft rear doos having been told to board up the rear steps though!\n\nEnjoy the great Alpine scenery on approach to Turin, as well as a fabulously clear flypast of London Heathrow at 20,000 feet!\n\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTHE WAY BACK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pprMWJWaldM  \n\n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek #luton #ltn #trn #easyjet\n\nMusic: panthurr – 10k feat Dixxy\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",

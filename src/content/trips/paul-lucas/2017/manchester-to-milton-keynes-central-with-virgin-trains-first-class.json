However, Virgin should be under no illusion that what they serve on board is NOT a dinner. The purpose of them serving hot meals on board is because their morning and evening trips cross breakfast time and dinner time. This gives busy people the opportunity to eat their meal on the train and not have to worry about getting up early for a breakfast, or make a dinner when they get home. There‚Äôs no way their tiny third of a fish with one potato and a few strips of root vegetables is a dinner! This was surprising because their breakfasts are quite sufficient. \n\nAs this was a night trip there‚Äôs not much to see outside so apologies if you feel this report is a bit light on content. However, starting next Sunday, new look Trip reports are coming in 4K HD, so sit tight and I hope you‚Äôre looking forward to 2018 as much as I am!\n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report and Happy New Year! üëçüèª\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

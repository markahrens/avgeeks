 "description": "A little bonus video on the reputable Submarine Safari from my week in Lanzarote. This underwater excursion operates from Puerto Calero in on the south coast, a pleasant and upmarket seaside village. \n\nI'm not a fish fan so don't expect in depth (ha!) subtitles, but I hope you enjoy the video anyway! Just sit back and watch the fish go past... üêü \n\nNot sure I've seen a submarine trip report before, so I thought I'd make this for a bit of fun. Definitely better - and more humane - than any aquarium. \n\nA full length trip report is available as always, this Sunday.",

I’m in a preferred seat, which is at the front of economy and directly behind business class (which AB only introduced recently). \n\nWhile I don’t like Q400 aircraft, they’re hardy and basic and do the job just fine. This was a no-fuss flight with Air Berlin, who occupy a strange niche as a pseudo-low cost carrier.\n\nHappy Easter and see you next Sunday…\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTRAINS, ANYONE? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iSjr-5LbaA \n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek #stuttgart #str #dus #dusseldorf #airberlin\n\nMusic: Xad - Story\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",

These are being retired fast so I was keen to capture a trip on video. So, instead of taking a direct flight between Houston and Miami, I took a stopover in DFW so I could catch an MD-80. \n\nWhy do I love the MD-80?\n\n1. Super quiet in First Class with the engines a long way behind you!\n2. Impressive climb performance. \n3. Nobody else likes them. \n4. They're extremely rare in Europe. \n5. They're very loud if you're outside the aircraft...\n\nAnyway I was glad to capture this. Big thumbs up for American and their new Admirals Club in Houston. A nicely appointed club with good staff and one of the best drinks facilities I've seen in a lounge so far!\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

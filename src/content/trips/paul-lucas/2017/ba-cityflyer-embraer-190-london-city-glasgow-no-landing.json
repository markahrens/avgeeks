 "description": "Snapchat: pauls_trips\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\n\nThis video doesn't have a landing on it - because of fog in Glasgow, we were instructed to turn off all electrical equipment while the aircraft performed an autoland using the ILS. But you can still enjoy a (shorter) trip report complete with airport highlights, takeoff, onboard service and landing....\n\n(sorry for the fog!)\n\nThanks for watching, and don't forget to subscribe!",

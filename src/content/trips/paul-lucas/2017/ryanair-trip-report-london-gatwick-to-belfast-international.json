I’m travelling between London Gatwick and Belfast International. \n\nDespite being a regular visitor to Belfast and to Northern Ireland, this was actually the first time I’ve ever used Belfast International Airport! I normally fly into City airport.\n\nThis was an excellent value trip costing under £20, one way. I hope you enjoy the fantastic views of eastern London in summer springtime, as well as a few notes on some interesting airfields we pass over on the way. Keep a good look out as we land into Aldergrove (the \"proper\" name for the airfield) for an Army Air Corps BN-Defender and a RAF C-130 Hercules. \n\nI’ve a soft spot for Ryanair who introduced me to the concept of going away on my own affordably when I was a teenager. They’re still a super value airline with unbeatable fares, and every time I fly them I think how fortunate we are in Europe to have burgeoning and successful budget airlines.\n\nEnjoy the video.\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTRAINS, ANYONE? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iSjr-5LbaA \n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek #ryanair\n\nMusic courtesy of Czech Vibes Sound\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",

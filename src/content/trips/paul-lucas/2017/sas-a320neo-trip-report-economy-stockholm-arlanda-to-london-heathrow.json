I really like SAS because they are very simple and efficient; you even scan your own bags and lounge entry is done by electronic gates. \n\nThis was a beautiful day for flying. The Uppland area of Sweden is full of huge forests and agricultural land which is very photogenic from the air. \n\nSAS provides good value for money on European short haul and I definitely recommend them. \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

(And SORRY for the sound issues on a few of the GoPro clips - I wasn’t able to fix this with the editing tools I have. Fortunately I’m starting to edit on Adobe Premiere as of next month! Thank you Patrons for contributing so I can afford the subscription!! 🙌🏻)\n\nSomething a little bit different this week. I ramble on for a bit at the beginning of this video (whoops), but hopefully it’ll give you some context about the video. I think it also shows how difficult it can be to organise making this sort of content.\n\nHumberside is one of the novelty Regional airports scattered around Britain that I haven’t yet “ticked off” (other airports like this are Durham Tees Valley and Newquay for example!). KLM have had a link to Amsterdam for as long as I can remember and is probably the marquee route for this small, strange former RAF base in the middle of North Lincolnshire. The hotel room I stayed in even looks out onto a Schiphol Road. \n\nIt was great to meet Sunil (unexpectedly!), and while it was disappointing to miss out on the retirement of one of my favourite aircraft, I really love the Embraers. Big windows, decent legroom, and a sleek design make it an aircraft I’m building a soft spot for. \n\nIf you’re a trip reporter with an established channel on YouTube, let me know if you’d like to collaborate with me in future!\n\nFarewell Fokker 70. 💙\n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! 👍🏻\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

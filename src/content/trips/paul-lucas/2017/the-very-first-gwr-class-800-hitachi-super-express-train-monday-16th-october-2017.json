GWR call theirs the Class 800 “Super Express”. \n\nToday, I had the absolute privilege of being on the VERY FIRST service train, the 0600 Bristol TM - London Paddington. But...trains aren’t supposed to have such a bumpy start to service! A cancellation for technical reasons, a reinstatement, a platform change, broken air con, a pantograph fault... this trip had it all. But for all the faults, I thought the 800 was a pretty solid train. \n\nWhat do you think of the train? Or the launch today? Leave me a comment!\n\nEnjoy the trip, and don’t forget to subscribe!\n\nMusic: Huma Huma - First Day",

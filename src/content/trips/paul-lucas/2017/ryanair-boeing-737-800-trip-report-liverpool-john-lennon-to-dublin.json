But I‚Äôve always liked them. This trip cost me under EIGHT POUNDS - ¬£4.99 for the flight and ¬£3.00 seat selection. No bags needed as this was a short trip. You really cannot beat that value. \n\nThis is my first report from Liverpool John Lennon Airport and it was my first visit in ten years. It was good to be back. Liverpool is a simple and efficient regional airport with a decent lounge considering it caters exclusively to low cost airlines and charter carriers. \n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ryanair will recover from their current situation. But even so, this trip is a reminder that I‚Äôm very lucky to live in Europe. If you really want to fly cheap, you can - and it‚Äôs fine. (But seriously, put a seat pocket in PLEASE Ryanair! That‚Äôs all I ask!)\n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

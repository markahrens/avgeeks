I‚Äôm releasing this on Christmas Eve (UK) and hope you all have a relaxing and happy Christmas. \n\nThis is a short report focusing on a standard Swiss International A319 flight between Bucharest and Zurich, in business class. I‚Äôve found Swiss to be a good quality carrier and this trip was no exception. \n\nBucharest-Otopeni Airport is one of the few pieces of infrastructure in Bucharest which is efficient and modern. I‚Äôve been here a few times and the new terminal is airy and pleasant. It‚Äôs also efficient and sensibly laid out, and there are a few airline lounges to choose from (though they are mostly the same!). \n\nThe only real complaint I can make is about the weather! Every time I‚Äôm in Bucharest I‚Äôm treated to this depressingly grey low cloud with poor visibility! So, there‚Äôs not a huge amount to see on the ground with this video, although the inflight service was top-notch thanks to a great crew. \n\nI have lots of videos coming out, including in midweek in the run up to New Year. Make sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

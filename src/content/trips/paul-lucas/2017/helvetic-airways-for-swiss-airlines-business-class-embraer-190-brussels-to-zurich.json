I‚Äôve got some great content planned for January 2018 using a new, proper camera and some professional editing software. \n\nHelvetic are a strange airline. They run their own flights, mainly on a charter basis, but as in this report they subcontract to Swiss International Airlines on certain intra-European routes. On this short hop in business class, follow me though the whole journey, with a bit of a focus on the excellent Brussels Airlines ‚ÄúLoft‚Äù Lounge at Brussels Airport. \n\nOverall, a pleasant flight on one of my favourite aircraft, the Embraer 190. Despite the 30 minute delay I enjoyed this flight, though it did help my hotel in Zurich was just a 5-minute tram ride from the airport!\n\nThis flight was booked as part of a complex multi-city itinerary with Swiss Airlines (including a 6-month stopover and a surface sector) so the costs I paid probably won‚Äôt be reflective of your own plans, if you‚Äôre interested!\n\nThe trip report I talk about in the beginning of the video is here - VLM Airlines London to Antwerp: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h2dmE6dBY44\n\nAnother trip will be coming on Sunday, as always. \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

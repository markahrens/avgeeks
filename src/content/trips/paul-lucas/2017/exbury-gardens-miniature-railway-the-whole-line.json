 "description": "Check out my Europe by Train Bright Trip guide: https://www.brighttrip.com/europebytrain\nA combination of illness and other commitments mean there's no full length trip report this weekend. Sorry! But here's something for the train enthusiasts - a full length ride over the full 1.5 miles on the delightfully English miniature train at Exbury Gardens. The UK has a plethora of narrow gauge and miniature railways like this, beautifully preserved by enthusiasts. \n\nDisappointed there's no full length trip report? Well, on Wednesday I fly to the United States, and you can look forward to videos on the following:\n\nBritish Airways 777-200 First Class (x2) \nAA MD80 First Class\nAA 777-200 new Business Class \nJetBlue Mint A321\nSouthwest Airlines 737-700\nDelta 717\nAmtrak Empire Builder, the whole way, Portland to Chicago\n\nPlus many more. \n\nwww.exbury.co.uk",

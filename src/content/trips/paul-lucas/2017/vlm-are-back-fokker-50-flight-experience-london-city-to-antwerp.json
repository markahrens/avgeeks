I‚Äôve a soft spot for them, having first been impressed with them back in 2009 when I travelled with them on the Manchester to London City route. Plus, they operate Fokker 50s and there are very few opportunities to fly on them, particularly in Europe. \n\nVLM have restarted using a Slovenian certificate, and they‚Äôre now based in Maribor, Slovenia although the airline‚Äôs history is distinctly Belgian. London to Antwerp is their only route right now (Antwerp having been a former base of theirs), and it‚Äôs a business rather than a leisure route. \n\nAs this is a business route with a lot of the tickets being bought on expenses, don‚Äôt expect very cheap tickets. Mine cost me ¬£109 single, which is expensive - but worth it to catch the unique experience of a quirky airline operating a beloved and rare aircraft. \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

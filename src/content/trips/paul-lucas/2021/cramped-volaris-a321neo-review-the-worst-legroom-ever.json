 "description": "Volaris has the MOST CRAMPED A321neo in the world, I'm fairly sure. If you know of an airline that puts more than 230 seats in one...let me know!\n\nThis really was a soulless and bone-shattering experience. At just 5 feet 8 inches, I can tolerate budget economy better than most. Flying cheaply means accepting service might be a bit weak and legroom won't be great...but this takes it to a new level!\n\n0:00 Introduction and SJD Airport\n0:49 VIP Lounge\n1:42 Planespotting\n2:21 Arrival of our aircraft\n3:09 Boarding\n5:20 Taxi and takeoff\n6:41 The food situation\n6:59 Laughably bad seat design\n7:34 No BEER emergency\n8:04 Fare talk\n9:30 Volaris recorded announcement\n10:05 Approach and landing\n10:33 Conclusion and thanks for watching!\n\nMerch store: https://teespring.com/stores/wingin-it-3\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¬¶ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\n\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¬¶ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me\n\nDate of Travel: 20 SEP 2021\nAirline: Volaris\nLivery: Standard Volaris PIXEL livery\nRoute: SJD-MEX\nAircraft: Airbus A321neo\nFlight Number: Y4 783\nMiles: 731\nAirborne time: 1h40m\n\nJoin me on PATREON where you'll get perks like AD-FREE EARLY ACCESS viewing of all my trip report videos, my tips and tricks for hacking fares, my \"best of the month\" airfare rundown, and MORE...support me: https://www.patreon.com/winginit\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

And my first trip was to...the Mull of Kintyre, taking in the shortest standalone flight on the island of Great Britain (alright, yes, Papa Westray-Westray is shorter but not technically on the island of GB, and you can still book Glasgow-Edinburgh too but that's a technical stop rather than a standalone route so...hey, everyone needs clickbait!).

 "name": "14 HOURS in Deluxe Nightjet Sleeper train: Amsterdam to Vienna",
 "description": "Nightjet's Amsterdam to Vienna service is one of the newest revivals of sleeper train routes in Europe! In the era of \"flygskam\", or flight shaming, can its deluxe sleeper really provide good value when crossing Europe? I check out my favourite sleeper train operator in this video again: Nightjet is a wonderful service and I hope you'll be a sleeper train convert too!\n\nI made a Bright Trip guide: https://www.brighttrip.com/europebytrain\n\nYou can book tickets like I did at https://www.oebb.at/en/ or at NS International: https://www.nsinternational.com/en (both English language pages)\n\nThis year I'll be taking more of the world's finest and most spectacular trains.

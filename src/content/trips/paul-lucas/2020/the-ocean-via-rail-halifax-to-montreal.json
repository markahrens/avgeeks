 "name": "The Ocean 🇨🇦 VIA Rail, Halifax to Montreal",
 "description": "A once in a lifetime trip aboard the Ocean - the oldest named passenger train still running in North America. This train is one of the most popular tourist routes in the world, and is usually very busy, but thanks to sheer chance, I took this train in between a service suspension due to line blockades and the COVID-19 crisis hitting Canada, so the train was practically empty, with no more than 30-40 passengers in the sleepers. So, enjoy, as I had the bullet lounge and the observation deck in the Assiniboine Park Car all to myself on this 800+ mile, 22 hour journey across Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec from Halifax to Montreal!\n\nCheck out my Europe by Train Bright Trip guide: https://www.brighttrip.com/europebytrain\n\nIf you enjoyed this, why not watch my: Amazing CrossCountry HST train trip in England! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA6MoteaJwU\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¦ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\n\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¦ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me\n\nJoin me on PATREON where you'll get perks like AD-FREE EARLY ACCESS viewing of all my trip report videos, my tips and tricks for hacking fares, my \"best of the month\" airfare rundown, and MORE...support me: https://www.patreon.com/winginit\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! 🛎 \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

 "name": "Farewell to the AMAZING 1938-era trains on the Isle of Wight",
 "description": "January 2021 is the final call for the vintage 1938 London Underground Stock trains that run on the Isle of Wight in England. Having served the public across ten decades, they'll retire on 3rd January 2021. These unique trains are special for a few reasons: they're by far the oldest stock running scheduled services for a Train Operating Company on the passenger network, they're the second in three generations of veteran Tube trains transported across the Solent to run on this unique island, and they're also the trains my dad learned to drive when he joined London Transport as a young(er!) man - and they were elderly trains even then!\n\nCheck out my Europe by Train Bright Trip guide: https://www.brighttrip.com/europebytrain\n\nMy UNIQUE hovercraft ride to the island: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8fQciHXmoQ&list=UUzuKzSNb8hGV9DsqIBUb79w\n\nI hope you'll join me for a final goodbye to these sublime trains, and enjoy a ride on the Isle of Wight's little railway network between Ryde Pier Head and Shanklin. Normal service resumes in January 2021 for my channel!\n\nThis video was filmed in September 2020, during relaxed public travel restrictions in England.\n\nA safe, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all; I hope you enjoy this little New Year bonus video!\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¦ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\n\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¦ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me",

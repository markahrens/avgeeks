 "description": "WATCH NOW: My AMAZING trip to the Isles of Scilly! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na9DkXYffQ8\n\nCheck out my Europe by Train Bright Trip guide: https://www.brighttrip.com/europebytrain\n\nThe Indian Pacific is one of the world's finest train journeys, carrying passengers on a three night, four day excursion, the full 4,352km across Australia between Sydney and Perth. This is a must-take trip for the rail enthusiast, being in the top five longest trains in the world, and traversing the world's longest straight piece of track (478km) on the Trans Australian Railway on the Nullarbor Plain. It's a luxury experience, encompassing several off-train stops and excursions at places of interest along the route.\n\nOn this trip, I was kindly hosted by Great Southern Rail, who operate this magnificent train.

 "name": "Brussels to Prague by EUROPEAN SLEEPER: The very FIRST train!",
 "description": "European Sleeper is now travelling to Prague! Previously a Brussels to Berlin train, it's just been extended to Prague and I was on board the inaugural run! I took a room in a P-class sleeper - a veteran 1950s design - and this spacious private room was the perfect way to spend 16 hours. Come for the unique train and service on board, stay for the brilliant scenery down the Elbe River on day 2! @europeansleeper1156 \n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¦ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¦ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\nNEW: Follow me on TikTok: @paul_winginit ¦ https://www.tiktok.com/@paul_winginit\n\nMany thanks to @SimplyRailway for his footage of the 5-berth couchette.

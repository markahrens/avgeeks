By a trick of fate they have temporarily ended up with an aircraft with first class seats, and for a modest upgrade...you can sit there! Their 737MAX was a fine way to travel between Delhi and Bombay and the unexpectedly personal service and affordable catering left a big impression on me. Even without the big seats, this is an airline hoping to impress and expand, and I'm excited to see what happens with this smart new airline in the years ahead.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¬¶ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\nFollow me on Instagram/Threads: paul_winginit ¬¶ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\nMerch store: https://wingin-it.teemill.com/collection/all-products/\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:57 Delhi Airport T2\n2:38 Akasa Air explainer and fare paid\n4:40 Gate views\n5:22 Arrival of our Akasa Air 737MAX8\n5:56 Surfshark sponsored segment\n7:26 Boarding A++ \"first class\" on Akasa Air\n8:40 Taxi and takeoff from Delhi\n10:12 Route map\n10:30 Cabin and seat review in A++  \n11:34 Food and onboard catering on Akasa\n12:20 Inflight views\n12:42 Approach and Landing into BOM\n13:10 Conclusions, thanks, and looking forward to the next one!\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me\n\nDate of Travel: 20 APRIL 2023\nAirline: Akasa Air\nLivery: Akasa Air standard livery \nRoute: DEL-BOM\nAircraft: Boeing 737MAX8\nFlight Number: QP 1128\nMiles: 707\nAirborne time: 1h 41m\n\n\nJoin me on PATREON where you'll get perks like AD-FREE EARLY ACCESS viewing of all my trip report videos, my tips and tricks for hacking fares, my \"best of the month\" airfare rundown, and MORE...support me: https://www.patreon.com/winginit\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

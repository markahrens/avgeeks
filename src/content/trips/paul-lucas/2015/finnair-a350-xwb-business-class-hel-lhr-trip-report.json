 "description": "I take Finnair's *brand new* A350 XWB aircraft on a test flight, from Helsinki to London, in Business Class. This is the first visit the Finnair A350 has made to London. \n\nI explore all aspects of the airport, lounge and flight experience; a comprehensive tour of the new Business Class seat and cabin. \n\nThis aircraft will be a game-changer for passengers heading to the Far East from Europe. Finnair offers a brilliant connection experience at Helsinki-Vantaa. \n\nLeave me a comment in the box below!

We have just arrived on a tight connection from Inverness so sadly no time for the lounge today - straight to the gate.\n\nWe board our aircraft and take our seat in the Club Europe (business class) cabin.  Soon we push back and enjoy the humourous British Airways Comic Relief safety video.  We taxi to runway 23L making a departure on this beautiful clear winters' morning.  \n\nWe are served a hot breakfast as we head south over Birmingham, the crew rushed for time to serve a full business class meal service on such a short flight!  We are already descending into Heathrow before we get served our breakfast and coffee!  We make a short hold at Bovingdon before making a beautiful arrival into Heathrow getting stunning views of London as we approach runway 27R.  We give way to a Turkish B777 as we taxi into Terminal 5.\n\nWe taxi to a remote stand and disembark via airstairs to a bus, which takes myself and my fellow business class passengers into the terminal to make our way through to the kerbside.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:07 Inside Manchester Airport, walking to gate\n0:00:53 Our aircraft for today in the beautiful Olympic Dove livery\n0:01:11 Boarding our aircraft, taking our seat\n0:07:04 Cabin view\n0:18:56 ATC: Route clearance to Heathrow\n0:29:45 ATC: Taxi clearance\n0:32:01 Safety video\n0:38:06 Taxi to runway 23L\n0:41:58 Line up and wait runway 23L\n0:44:12 Take off runway 23L\n0:48:31 Cabin view\n0:52:24 Hot towel service\n0:55:09 Cabin view\n0:56:11 Birmingham Airport (BHX)\n0:59:25 Breakfast service\n1:01:20 Hot breakfast meal\n1:17:57 Commencing approach over London\n1:19:37 Final approach to runway 27R\n1:24:43 Landing runway 27R\n1:35:42 Disembarking, bus to terminal 5\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"RM-SlSal1_k",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1515160791000)};

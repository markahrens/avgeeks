const data = {name:"WestJet 737-8CT [C-FUSM] (Split Scimitar Winglets) Close Up Taxi at Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"New spot! :D As you can see in the video, this location is right next to Taxiway Romeo, one of the 3 taxiways connecting YYC's existing infrastructure with that of the new runway, meaning that this taxiway sees fairly heavy use. Aircraft using this taxiway also go right over a bridge, which is quite an impressive sight! Definitely not something we're used to at YYC! This spot also has great views of 35R arrivals and departures, as well as 17L departures and 17L arrivals taxiing by. I'll be updating my spotting guide to YYC with this spot soon.\n\nAnyway, here is my first decent capture of an aircraft with the new Split Scimitar winglets. I just love the way they look! Not to mention the awesome lighting and the very impressive sight of the plane taxiing extremely close to me! I will definitely be back here soon...\n\nThanks for watching!

const data = {name:"FIRST VISIT! Air Canada 737 MAX 8 [C-FSCY] Takeoff, Touch and Go (x2) at Calgary Airport",description:"Air Canada's 737 MAX in action at YYC Calgary International Airport for the first time! Air Canada brought their newest aircraft to Calgary International Airport for some training late yesterday evening, before departing this morning on some training flights for pilots, doing touch and goes between Calgary and Edmonton! They did two flights, about 4 hours each, with 4 touch and goes in both cities. Here we have C-FSCY, AC's second 737 MAX 8, pushing back, taxiing, and taking off runway 35L for Edmonton before returning back here early this morning, and then doing another touch and go here just after sunset. ATC is included throughout, hope you enjoy my first catch of this new aircraft type for Air Canada! It looks sharp in the new livery! \n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 737 MAX 8 (B38M)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x CFMI LEAP-1B\nRegistration: C-FSCY \nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Edmonton (YEG) - YYC - YEG - YYC - YEG\nCallsign: Air Canada 7096/7097\nRunway used: 35L (all)\nDate filmed: December 7, 2017\nLocal time: 0730, 0930, 1630\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFSCY\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2017\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"Yo6_bnYnMm8",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1512709506000)};

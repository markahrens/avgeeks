American Airlines Flagship First. Yes there are plenty of flights named “first class” yet there is really only one true first class product stateside. \n\nWith pricing in excess of $2500 each way, it’s an expensive affair but appears to offer what you’d expect internationally when flying First. Krug Champagne, a private airport wing and of course fine dining both on the ground and in the air. Well today I’m going to find out if this really is a true First Class or yet another gimmick, which a high price tag to boot. Let’s get onboard the Airbus A321T, a very special edition, transcontinental aircraft. Designed specifically for this task, of flying passengers coast to coast. Mind you, the aforementioned flagship first, is only offered on three such routes, San Francisco, Orange County and Los Angeles. \n\nAs usual with my trip reports, i'll review all aspects of the experience, from the onboard service, dining, bed/seat and ground service. \n\nFollow along live with my travels on IG: will.luxurytravel",source:"youtube",source_id:"uJzwXbtj0Zw",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1639344362000)};

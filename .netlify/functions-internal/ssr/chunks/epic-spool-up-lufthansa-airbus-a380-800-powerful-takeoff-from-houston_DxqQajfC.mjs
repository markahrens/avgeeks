const data = {name:"Epic Spool Up! - Lufthansa Airbus A380-800 Powerful Takeoff from Houston ᴴᴰ",description:"Jump to 7:50 for spool up! I sure chose a great seat, didn't I? ;) I was so happy to get such a great sound, and specifically chose this seat for that reason, since the entire main deck on LH's A380s is all economy. \n\nThis was my very first flight on the \"whale\", and it was a very smooth flight. The aircraft is so big that I didn't even feel when it started to move! There were some complaints I had about the aircraft, and you'll see what they are in an upcoming video.\n\nSorry for any shakiness or unlevel shots, The windows on the A380 are very thick and are hard to film out of, especially when you're sitting this far forward. The scratched window was a bit of a shame too, but I hope you'll still enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

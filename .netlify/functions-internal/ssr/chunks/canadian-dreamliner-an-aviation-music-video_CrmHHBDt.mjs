This music video features some footage of the 787 taxiing, an exterior and interior walkaround, and then some footage from the first touch and go that the 787 did at Calgary International Airport.\n\nAfter all this, I can only say that C-GHPQ will always have a special place in my heart :)\n\nThanks for watching!

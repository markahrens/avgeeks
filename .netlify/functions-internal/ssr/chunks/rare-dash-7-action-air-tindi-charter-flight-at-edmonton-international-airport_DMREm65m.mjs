const data = {name:"RARE DASH 7 ACTION! Air Tindi Charter Flight at Edmonton International Airport",description:"On January 2nd, Air Tindi of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories operated a special charter flight to Edmonton with their rare Dash 7! Air Tindi is the largest civilian operator of the Dash 7 in the world, but it's exceptionally rare to see those in Alberta, so I knew I had to make the drive up.\n\nThey did three of these flights in total over the holiday season, as an extra option for those needing to get from Yellowknife to the south or vice versa. I'm glad I was able to catch at least one of them, and to see the Dash 7 up close while it was parked! Huge thank you to everyone who made that happen! Enjoy this rare Dash 7 action!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

const data = {name:"AFTERNOON RUSH at FRANKFURT AIRPORT! Runway 25L Plane Spotting [4K]",description:"Back in May, I visited Frankfurt Airport on a brief trip to Europe to fly on Lufthansa's 747-400 and naturally had to do some spotting at one of Europe's busiest airports! Some highlights include a Boeing 747-200 STILL flying, as well as a couple new carriers for me like Bamboo Airways of Vietnam.\n\nA huge thank you to @JonathanWinton123 for coming over to Germany to meet up! It was a great couple hours of spotting with some amazing variety, and I hope you all enjoy these 20+ minutes of runway 25L action!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

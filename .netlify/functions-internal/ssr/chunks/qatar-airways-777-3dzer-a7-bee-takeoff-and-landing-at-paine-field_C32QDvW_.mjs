Here we have one of Qatar Airways' many 777-300ERs undergoing a test flight back in 2015 prior to being delivered to the airline. This one is the 29th 77W for the airline, now about 2 1/2 years old, filmed here at Paine Field in July of 2015. I don't think I've actually filmed a Qatar 777-300ER aside from this one, so I hope you enjoy this, at the time, brand new 77W with some fantastic sound on takeoff!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Qatar AIrways (QTR/QR)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-300ER (B77W)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE90-115B\nRegistration: A7-BEE\nRoute: Paine Field (PAE) - Moses Lake (MWH) - Paine Field (PAE)\nCallsign: Boeing ??? heavy\nRunway used: 16R\nDate filmed: July 2015\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/A7BEE\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"21hCeXylLNA",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1512325617000)};

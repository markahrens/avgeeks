const data = {name:"Waving Pilot! Air Canada 777-333ER [C-FIVS] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Air Canada's 777-300ERs are the largest semi-regular passenger aircraft at Calgary International Airport. In the winter months, they're usually sent to cover for some cancelled flights on the Calgary to Toronto route, one of our busiest domestic routes. This summer however, Air Canada will be flying their 77W on the Calgary to London Heathrow route, making it the first time we've had regular 77W service since 2014. Looking forward to seeing these gorgeous aircraft again! Enjoy this equipment change taxiing up close and departing runway 35R back in March, with a friendly first officer (and ATC, as always)!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-300ER (B77W)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Old (2004-2017)\nEngines: 2x GE90-115B\nRegistration: C-FIVS\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Toronto (YYZ)\nCallsign: Air Canada 140 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: March 24, 2017\nLocal time: 1830\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFIVS\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"uHs8N2PFGp4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1494630284000)};

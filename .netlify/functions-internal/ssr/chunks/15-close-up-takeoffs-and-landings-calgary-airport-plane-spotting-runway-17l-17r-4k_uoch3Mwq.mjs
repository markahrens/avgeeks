const data = {name:"15 CLOSE UP TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS! Calgary Airport Plane Spotting Runway 17L + 17R (4K)",description:"Traffic has been ramping up again at Calgary Airport over the past few weeks, and August so far has been the busiest I've seen the airport in a long time. Shame about the smoke but there was still some nice spotting to be had!\n\nHere are 15 close-up landings and takeoffs on the 17s on a smoky summer afternoon/evening! Includes a rare visit from Nolinor Aviation (OWG)'s 737-400, as well as the very first Air Canada transatlantic flight from Calgary since March 2020.\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video!

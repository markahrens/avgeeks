Use the following link and coupon code DENNIS to take advantage of the exclusive special offer available to my viewers:  https://www.dashlane.com/dennis\n\nIn Episode 1 of this series of Classic Flights I have taken we board the majestic 747 Queen of the Skies to indulge in some first class luxury with Thai Airways.\n\nFirst Class on the Thai Airways 747 is sensational!  This really is Royal First Class in a classic sense. \n\nThe Thai First Class experience starts when you arrive at Bangkok Airport and are greeted at the dedicated Royal First Class check in. You are then escorted through security and driven to the Thai First Class Lounge. \n\nThis first class flight review covers the first class lounge at Bangkok Airport, boarding the iconic Boeing 747, take off and the wonderful onboard service of the Thai Airways staff. I cover the first class cabin layout, the first class seat which converts into a fully flat bed and Thai Royal First Class amenities including their PJs! Dining in first class is an experience â€“ and on Thai Royal First Class it is a wonderful experience! \n\nThe food is full of Thai flavours and there is so much food that you will definitely not go hungry! \n\nThis flight was filmed on TG475 from Bangkok to Sydney Australia. \n\nRoute: Bangkok (BKK) to Sydney (SYD) \nLength: 4,675miles, 8:450 hrs \nFlight: TG475 \nWhen: February 2018 \nAircraft: Boeing 747-400 registration HS-TGY \nSeat: 1A Camera: Sony FDR-AXP55 \n\nThis video may not be reproduced without specific permission. \n\nThumbnail photo credit: https://julianherzog.com/ via Wikipedia",source:"youtube",source_id:"XDPf1deFreg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1597283237000)};

This video features C-FITL, Air Canada's first 777, taxiing close up onto the apron after landing, and then departing back to Toronto with ATC included, as well as captions. Apologies for any unlevel shots during the first portion of the video, I was standing on a very conveniently placed snow pile that wasn't very stable. Enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

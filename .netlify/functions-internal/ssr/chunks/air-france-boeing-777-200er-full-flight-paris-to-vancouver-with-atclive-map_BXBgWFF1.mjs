We are following the connections channel after our arrival on a connecting flight from the UK.  We make our way to the gate where we must take a bus to our remote stand.\n\nThe bus takes us across the airport in the rain to our waiting aircraft, Boeing 777-200ER F-GSPL.  We have the pleasure of boarding through air stairs in front of the huge engine, before making our way to row 46 which will be our home for the next 11 hours.\n\nWe soon push back and taxi before taking off to the west.  After leaving the rain of Paris behind the weather soon clears up and we get some good views of France and the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey.  We then turn towards Lands End in Cornwall, UK, before crossing the south of Ireland and heading straight towards Greenland.  We get some good views across Greenland and Northern Canada, before crossing Canada's Northwest Territories,\n Alberta and British Colombia.  We commence our descent into an equally rainy Vancouver, making a final approach over the Georgia Strait, touching down on runway 08L.\n\nWe taxi to the terminal and disembark, walking through Vancouver Airport to the US connections channel.\n\n0:00:06 Entering Terminal 2E at Paris Charles-de-Gaulle, walking to transfer desk\n0:01:41 Walking to K gates in Terminal 2E\n0:07:07 At the gate, walking to bus\n0:08:56 Boarding bus to aircraft, bus ride to aircraft\n0:28:08 Boarding aircraft\n0:35:33 Cabin view\n0:48:02 Cabin view\n1:07:06 Pushback, engine start\n1:09:51 Safety video\n1:19:30 Take off\n1:34:09 Cabin view\n1:35:05 Cabin view\n1:37:00 Cabin view\n1:42:57 Menu for dinner\n1:55:22 Guernsey, Channel Islands\n1:57:11 Snack and drink service\n2:04:35 Contrails forming outside the window\n2:16:40 Air show map demonstration\n2:31:43 Demonstration of IFE system\n2:41:54 Dinner service, chicken chosen\n2:48:15 Watching a movie about 'Patrouille de France'\n3:36:06 Walk around tour of the rear cabin and galley\n5:31:26 Air show map demonstration over Greenland\n5:38:25 Cabin view\n5:39:07 Cabin view\n5:50:57 Views over Greenland\n6:01:13 Mountains of Western Greenland\n6:07:08 Cabin view\n6:25:28 Contrails forming outside the window\n7:08:12 Walk around tour of rear cabin, crew rest area, galley and washroom\n7:14:14 Ice cream service\n7:18:42 Close pass with an Emirates Boeing 777-300ER, flying from Dubai to Houston\n9:34:11 Snack service: Grilled cheese with chicken\n9:38:48 Cabin view\n9:42:23 Contrails forming outside the window\n9:43:47 Contrails forming outside the window\n9:48:23 Cabin view\n10:05:40 Air show map\n10:12:50 Highland Valley Copper Mine, BC\n10:17:12 Cabin view\n10:17:40 Commencing descent into Vancouver\n10:21:01 Fast rate of descent on air show map\n10:38:41 Final approach to runway 08L at Vancouver\n10:41:40 Landing on runway 08L\n10:49:13 Disembarking into terminal, walking to US transfers\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"2P1N-aiQsmI",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1516370414000)};

Once airborne, it's a turn to the left and we soon start to make up time. We climb straight to 38,000ft, flying towards Cologne, making a left turn to fly to the north of Brussels directly over Antwerp, crossing the coast near to Ostend and getting a great view of the shipping traffic in the Straits of Dover. We make landfall directly over Southend on Sea, commencing our descent heading northwest towards Luton, Milton Keynes, and finally a series of sweeping turns over Leamington Spa and Coventry to put us on track for an on-time landing on runway 33 at Birmingham.\n\nVideo taken from seat 21A.\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

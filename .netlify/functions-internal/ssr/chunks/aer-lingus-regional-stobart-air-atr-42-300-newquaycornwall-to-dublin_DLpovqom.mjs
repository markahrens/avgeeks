Newquay-Cornwall to Dublin is one of those! \n\nThis was a pleasant short flight on board an aircraft which is an antique by European standards - 27 years old - older than a lot of my subscribers, I guess! I also love the fact that Newquay has a small airport lounge as well (thanks Priority Pass!), which had only me and one other visiting that morning. It was sad to see at least four Monarch aircraft parked in various places at Newquay, awaiting distress buyers. RIP Monarch and thanks for the memories - I remember flying on an A300 from Gatwick to Malaga like it was yesterday. \n\nNewquay is a long way away from the bustle of Heathrow and Gatwick and is a pleasure to use. It‚Äôs also got a long and proud history as RAF St Mawgan (and even earlier as RAF Trebelzue). Cornwall is a really underrated part of the world - and an underrated region of England, come to think of it. \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

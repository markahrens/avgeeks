const data = {name:"Air Canada 767-38E/ER [C-GDUZ] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"Hey everybody, for today's video we have an Air Canada Boeing 767-38E/ER departing Calgary International Airport, bound for Tokyo. This aircraft has quite a bit of history, originally being delivered to Asiana Airlines in 1991 (As evidenced by the different customer code), and transferred to Canadian Airlines in '98, which became Air Canada. Listen to those CF-6s spooling up, and sorry for the shakiness, it was pretty windy out that day. Hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

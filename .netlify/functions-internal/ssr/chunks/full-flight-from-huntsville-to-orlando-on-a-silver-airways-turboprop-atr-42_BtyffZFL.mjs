const data = {name:"Full Flight from Huntsville to Orlando on a Silver Airways Turboprop ATR-42",description:"Welcome to this Full Flight Experience aboard a Silver Airways ATR-42-600 from Hunstsville International Airport to Orlando International Airport!\r\n\nSilver Airways, a regional, Floridian airline, provides service to a number of destinations in and around Florida. It acts as a primary gateway between Florida and the Bahamas using small, but well-equipped turboprop planes. Silver Airways provides great fares between their domestic destinations, so I wanted to give them a try while flying to one of my favorite airports in the U.S. \r\n\n\r\n\nWe're taking an early-morning flight from one of their newest destinations: Huntsville, Alabama. Through this service, Huntsville is connected to one of Silver's three hubs in Orlando, where you can connect to other, smaller airports in Florida and to the islands of the Bahamas. \r\n\n\r\n\nThis enjoyable, leisurely flight to Orlando brings beautiful sights, the roar of the turboprop, and the Southern service you can expect from a small, local airline. The brand-new aircraft we're riding provides a comfortable and exciting ride along the edge of the Gulf of Mexico and over the myriad lakes of the Sunshine State.\r\n\n\r\n\nTake a flight with me, and enjoy the ride!\r\n\n\r\n\nVideo Timeline\r\n\n00:20 - Boarding\r\n\n00:35 - ATR-42 Interior\r\n\n01:00 - Captain's Announcement\r\n\n01:30 - Engine Startup\r\n\n02:30 - Takeoff\r\n\n04:00 - Snack Service and Seat Contents\r\n\n04:30 - Timelapse of Flight\r\n\n05:00 - Initial Descent and Approach\r\n\n05:50 - Landing\r\n\n07:30 - Gate Arrival\r\n\n08:00 - Deplaning\r\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\nFlight Information\r\n\nAirline: Silver Airways\r\n\nFlight Number: 3M 69\r\n\nDate of Flight: Tuesday, September 10th, 2019\r\n\n\r\n\nOrigin Airport: Huntsville International Airport (KHSV/HSV)\r\n\nDestination Airport: Orlando International Airport (KMCO/MCO)\r\n\n\r\n\nDeparting Gate: 12\r\n\nBoarding Time: 07:53 CDT\r\n\nScheduled Departure: 08:00 CDT\r\n\nActual Departure from Gate: 08:02 CDT\r\n\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 18 / 08:07 CDT\r\n\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 36L / 11:07 EDT\r\n\nScheduled Arrival: 11:10 EDT\r\n\nActual Arrival at Gate: 11:13 EDT\r\n\nArriving Gate: 13\r\n\n\r\n\n--------------------------------\r\n\n\r\n\nAircraft Information\r\n\nType: ATR-42-600\r\n\nRegistration: N403SV\r\n\nAircraft Delivery: August 2019 (!)\r\n\nEngines: 2 x PW127M\r\n\n\r\n\n--------------------------------\r\n\n\r\n\nGear\r\n\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\r\n\nCanon Vixia HFM30\r\n\nGoPro Hero 7 Black\r\n\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView\r\n\n\r\n\nAircraft and flight information from planespotters.net and flightaware.com.\r\n\n\r\n\nMap graphics and information from OpenStreetMap.com.

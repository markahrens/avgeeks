Here we have an Air France 777-200ER departing Los Angeles, bound for Paris. Unfortunately, the Air France A380 flight that day was cancelled, but I was able to get this instead :) \n\nAnd as with every Air France video I make, this is dedicated to an awesome friend and fellow spotter, Montreal Plane Spotting! Check out his epic channel here: www.youtube.com/CYULPlaneSpotter\n\nHe's also caught this same aircraft in Montreal before, check out that video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urdgqL9-9U0\n\nThanks for watching!

const data = {name:"How to Fly with AIR KENYA to a Masai Mara SAFARI",description:"In this video, you’ll see how to fly out on Safari, get a sense for why you should do it, and even see the \"JebScore\" for this unusual experience.\n\nWatch this video to see exactly how to travel out to the Masai Mara from Nairobi with Air Kenya onboard some pretty amazing airplanes. This video highlights a De Havilland Dash 7 built in 1982, a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan from 2003, and a De Havilland Twin Otter from 1974!\n\nWe'll fly with Air Kenya and help you see how to get to the Masai Mara for an ultimate Safari. We'll start at the Nairobi Wilson Airport before flying from Nairobi to the Masai Mara flight onboard a Dash 7, a Cessna Caravan, and a Twin Otter. All with the goal of showing you how to fly on a safari!\n\nYou’ll see what it’s like inside each of those airplanes as well as get some “must have” information before you take-off on your own Kenya Safari adventure!\n\nAnd, to that point, here's a link to the Air Kenya Baggage Requirements:\nhttps://www.airkenya.com/images/Baggage%20policy%20-%20final-1.pdf\n\nBack in 2018, Suzanne and I took our first big international trip together. We flew to Kenya for a weekend. It made sense to repeat that experience, returning to Kenya’s Masai Mara for our honeymoon, the #NewlywedWorldTour, three years later!\n\nFor a playlist of all of the trips on our honeymoon, check this out:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFeqHICip0iEr-LevojtIU05t\n\nHere’s a link to that original video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQgZi9t8BT0\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:13 Wilson Airport\n2:56 Departing for the Masai Mara\n3:46 Approach into the Masai Mara\n4:06 Connecting Flight\n5:49 Second Landing in the Masai Mara\n6:20 Departing the Masai Mara\n7:25 JebScore\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nRoscoe’s Dream – Philip Ayers\nTrails of Africa – Sight of Wonders\nArriving in Ghana – Sahara Skylight\nBusy Feet – Sahara Skylight\nBorder Entrance – Trailer Worx\nSafari Caravan – Sight of Wonders\nJaama – Sillaba",source:"youtube",source_id:"EC6rqbwsPRA",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1637427619000)};

const data = {name:"The SMALLEST EUROPEAN AIRPORT with a TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHT - Rzeszów to Newark",description:"Rzeszów is a city of around 300,000 people in southeastern Poland, served by Rzeszów-Jasionka International Airport, a small airport which itself handles around 700,000 passengers a year. In April 2018, LOT Polish Airlines started a year-round, once weekly service between Rzeszów and New York-Newark with a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. With that, RZE became the smallest airport in Europe with a transatlantic connection. LOT had previously operated seasonal flights to New York from Rzeszów with their 767s in years past, but those stopped around 2010.\n\nHere we have SP-LRB, LOT's second Dreamliner to be delivered, arriving on runway 27 and departing a few hours later back to Newark off of runway 09. As you can see in the start of the video, the sight of a widebody brings quite the crowd to RZE's observation deck! Hope you all enjoy this footage of this unique flight.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: LOT Polish Airlines (LOT/LO)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (B788)\nFlight Number: LO17/LO18\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New\nEngines: 2x RR Trent 1000\nRegistration: SP-LRB\nRoute: New York-Newark (EWR) - Rzeszow-Jasionka (RZE) - New York-Newark (EWR)\nCallsign: LOT 017/018 heavy\nRunway used: 27 (arrival) 09 (departure)\nDate filmed: July 2018\nLocal time: 1000/1400\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"iewUzYMOIxA",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1538762407000)};

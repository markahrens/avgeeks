const data = {name:"200TH VIDEO: Plane Spotting at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport- \"Sea-Tac\"",description:"These are the only videos I got from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (KSEA/SEA) when I was there. I did manage to catch some interesting things, such as the Alaska Dreamliner livery on a 737-800, a Frontier A320 with Sharklets, and a Delta 757-300, as you can see in the video. I know the clips are very shaky, so sorry about that. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my 200th upload!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nMusic is \"Majestic Hills\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2013\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"fxZ3sfUEPq4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1378057259000)};

As those of you who follow me on Snapchat will know, I spent a week's holiday in Playa Blanca, and this is the outbound flight. \n\nA very pleasant trip from Gatwick here, using the Galleries First Class lounge for a spot of breakfast! The previous night was spent at the Bloc hotel in the South Terminal which is well worth checking out if you ever need to stay overnight. \n\nOverall, a good experience, but 4 hours is my personal limit for spending time in what is basically an economy seat. (Also, BA: why no blankets or pillows on this flight?)\n\nOver the course of the next year I will travel gradually less in European business class and concentrate more on unusual airlines, routes, as well as some ultra high-end First Class trips (Etihad, Cathay Pacific, and hopefully JAL to come next year). \n\nThere are just two months to go until my next First Class trip, with BA to Houston!\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

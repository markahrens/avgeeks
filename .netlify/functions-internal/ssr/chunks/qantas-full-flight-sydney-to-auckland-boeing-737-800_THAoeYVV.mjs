Once we arrive at the international terminal we head to the departure lounge to await boarding of our flight.  When boarding's called, we walk to the gate and board the aircraft, taking out seat in seat 25F.\n\nIt's soon time for pushback and make our lengthy taxi to runway 34R where we make a powerful takeoff to the north, followed by a sharp right turn before we get to the airport fence to take us on track towards New Zealand.\n\nWe climb to our cruising altitude of 37,000ft as we commence our trip across the Tasman Sea.  Breakfast is served and we enjoy a clear ride on a relatively smooth day, until we get closer to New Zealand and encounter some turbulence, where we climb to 38,000ft.  We commence our descent into Auckland getting a great view of the Manukau Heads on final approach to runway 05 where we make a smooth touchdown right on schedule.\n\nWe taxi to the international terminal and disembark into the terminal at Auckland.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:06 Airside bus ride from domestic terminal to international\n0:07:06 Walking to security checkpoint\n0:08:51 Departure lounge, walking to restaurants\n0:10:19 Walking around departure lounge\n0:11:46 View of the apron at Sydney\n0:12:28 Boarding called, walking to gate 55\n0:19:27 Boarding aircraft, taking seat in 25F\n0:25:28 Cabin view\n0:28:11 Cabin view\n0:32:21 Pushback, engine start\n0:33:39 Safety video\n0:38:01 Taxi to runway 34R\n0:49:51 Takeoff runway 34R\n1:01:26 Cabin view\n1:02:02 Tour of airshow map system\n1:05:04 Tour of inflight entertainment system (IFE)\n1:40:54 Seat overview\n1:43:03 Breakfast service begins\n2:02:15 Breakfast - omelette chosen\n2:29:19 Cabin view\n2:32:06 Cabin view\n2:35:34 Captain progress update from flightdeck\n2:35:48 Cabin view\n2:37:32 Airshow map showing flight progress\n2:52:13 Funny video about NZ quarantine regulations\n3:19:29 Final approach over Manukau Heads\n3:23:42 Landing on runway 05\n3:31:37 Disembarking aircraft, walking to international transfers\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"mQpT9oIFpZM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1524834004000)};

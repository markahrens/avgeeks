const data = {name:"EXPLORING THAI ISLANDS | Country #12 of 12",description:"To complete my aim of 12 countries in 12 months, I flew from Beijing (where I was in my previous episode) to Bangkok, Thailand. We stayed a few nights at the Avani hotel, exploring some of the epic sights which Bangkok has to offer - such as temples, awesome food and massive shopping malls. Then after nearly missing our flight over to Phuket (thankfully the one we were on got cancelled!) we were put on the next evening flight over to Patong, Phuket! We experienced beach parties, authentic thai food and countless bars here. Then we took a boat over to Koh Phi Phi taking a couple of hours. And my word what a paradise, Koh Phi Phi is gorgeous, we hiked across the mountains, swam, sunbathed and partied! What more could you want for a tropical island! Finally get a peak at the 1st class lounge at Phuket airport which I managed to wing access to. Enjoy guys!

const data = {name:"55-YEAR-OLD DC-9 STILL FLYING! Ameristar DC-9-15 at Calgary Airport (4K)",description:"Last week, this extremely rare Douglas DC-9 operated by Ameristar flew into Calgary on a special charter of some sort.\n\nThis DC-9-15 is now 55 years old, and is actually a former Air Canada one too! It landed and taxied to Apron 6 where they cleared customs, got some fuel, and then started up again to pick up cargo on a different apron.\n\nHowever, it seemed there was a bit of a miscommunication somewhere, and the plane ended up taxiing around most of the airport before eventually finding its cargo back at Apron 6.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough though, they had another 3 hour delay because of ATC issues at their destination of Las Vegas, so they waited as long as they could before the crew seemingly timed out. They stayed overnight and left the next morning for Great Falls instead.\n\nAll of this at least led to us getting a few more angles of this iconic classic aircraft, and this was certainly a visit to remember. Enjoy this rare DC-9 in action!\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

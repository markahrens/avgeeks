We make our way through the crowds in the packed terminal to our gate, where we catch a bus across the ramp to a remote stand where our aircraft is waiting to take us to Sofia.\n\nWe board through the front steps and take our seat in 7F, and wait for the aircraft to be refuelled.  After a short delay we push back and taxi to runway 35R where we join the queue for evening departures.  The sun sets as we line up for takeoff, and we depart getting a beautiful view of Istanbul at dusk.  Once we are over the sea and heading east, the sun rises once more illuminating the engine in a beautiful orange colour, before it sets once more over Bulgaria.\n\nWe commence our descent and make a beautiful approach and landing over the city of Sofia, where we land on schedule and taxi into the gate  We disembark and head towards the taxi ramp to get a ride to a nearby hotel.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:04 Inside terminal at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, walking to gate\n0:07:16 Ramp view\n0:07:33 At gate 306, waiting for boarding\n0:08:40 Boarding commences, boarding bus to aircraft\n0:09:49 Bus ride across airport to remote stand\n0:12:39 Leaving bus, boarding the aircraft\n0:16:33 Cabin view\n0:18:19 Cabin view\n0:25:41 Cabin view\n0:27:05 Pushback and engine start\n0:31:06 Safety video, taxi to runway 35R\n0:43:13 Takeoff runway 35R\n0:56:02 Snack and drinks service\n1:16:59 Commencing descent into Sofia\n1:34:06 Final approach and landing into Sofia\n1:36:28 Landing at Sofia, taxi to gate\n1:46:46 Disembark aircraft, walk through terminal to street\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"1EuYswZbpq0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1530277196000)};

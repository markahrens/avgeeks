const data = {name:"Cargojet Airways 757-223PCF [C-FGKJ] Dawn Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"CargoJet is Canada's largest cargo airline, serving a multitude of destinations in and around our fine country. They also operate a number of contract flights into YYC, this one being operated for DHL from Cincinnati every weekday, flying CVG-YYC-YEG-YYC-CVG. Seen here is \"CargoJet 920\" landing on runway 17L arriving from CVG just before sunrise. Always nice to 757s, no matter the configuration! ATC is included, and I hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: CargoJet Airways (CJT/W8)\nAircraft: Boeing 757-200PCF(WL) (B752)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x RR RB211-535E4B \nRegistration: C-FGKJ\nRoute: CVG-YYC\nCallsign: CargoJet 920\nRunway used: 17L\nLocal Time: 0730\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFGKJ\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"5s5loyvmvDg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1487385123000)};

const data = {name:"London to Perth - Qantas' longest flight in business class",description:"It’s the first scheduled direct non-stop service between the UK and Australia and when it launched Qantas hyped it up like nothing else.  So now that it’s had a chance to settle what is this ultra-long-haul flight really like? And how does flying non-stop compare to the traditional one-stop services via the Gulf and Asian hubs?  Join me to find out. \n\nAt just over 9,000 miles the London to Perth route is the 3rd longest flight in the world.  What makes this one unique is that it links two previously unlinked continents – Europe and Australia. (I assume in a post-Brexit world the UK has not declared itself a separate continent yet!)\n\nI fly from London to Perth in the comfort of Qantas business class on the 787.  This business class flight review on the Qantas 787 covers the entire Qantas business class experience from the Qantas lounge at London Heathrow right through to the inflight service and landing at Perth Airport. \n\nHere are the links to the videos I refer to the video:\n\nDelta One Business Class A350:  https://youtu.be/zba0o2GmDPI\nKLM 747 Upper Deck Business Class:  https://youtu.be/zdWNTI-GifA\n\nJoin me and we’ll experience it together.  \n\nRoute:     London (LHR) to Perth (PER)\nLength:   9,025 miles, 16:12 hrs\nFlight:     QF10   Seat 7K\nAircraft:  Boeing 787-9  registration VH-ZNE (June 2018) \nWhen:    16 July 2019\n\nCamera:  Panasonic HC-VX1\n\n\nThis video may not be reproduced without specific permission.\n\nQ&A Video:       https://youtu.be/6VoRFtNDC04\nThe Business Trip:   https://youtu.be/xgNXuBTyDTQ\nThe Business Trip – IndoChina:  https://youtu.be/pkNcpk2whLU\n\n\nFirst Class Reviews:\n\nSingapore Airlines A380 First Class Suites for 2    https://youtu.be/ITSNdSJ_MnU\nEtihad A380 First Class Apartment:   https://youtu.be/vAl5AFzQyIo\nEmirates 777 First Class:     https://youtu.be/hwHupTHbGVk\nEmirates A30 First Class:     https://youtu.be/ulgxwkG87Fs\nSingapore Airlines A380 First Class Suite:  https://youtu.be/yNoNrAXS38I\nThai Airways 747 Royal First Class:    https://youtu.be/UkhbKJb1WiU\nSwiss Air A340 First Class:    https://youtu.be/CuXLDEtpKzU\nQantas A380 First Class:      https://youtu.be/Mv4kBPUqGQU\nCathay Pacific 777 First Class:     https://youtu.be/52kIrUm3o08\nLufthansa First Class A340:    https://youtu.be/Y6evcYcwIqU",source:"youtube",source_id:"nMllaCgDj8w",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1569723977000)};

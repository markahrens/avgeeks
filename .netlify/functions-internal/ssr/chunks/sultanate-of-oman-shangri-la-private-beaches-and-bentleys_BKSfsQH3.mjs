This gorgeous country seems distant to what many may think as a suggested holiday destination, but I can assure you, it’s AMAZING!\n\nIn a two part series I have documented my trip over to the sultanate, firstly exploring the opulence of the Shangri La Barr Al Jissah Resort Muscat, and then embarking on a road trip down to Nizwa and up into the mountains. You’ll notice the stark contrast between the sea side and the mountains, and perhaps find more about a place which you haven’t seen much about before. For those of you familiar with Oman I hope i’ve given a provocative insight into a perspective of luxury travel in the country, and inspired at least a couple of trips to the world class Al Husn wing at the Shangri-La. \n\nIn this part of the trip I show you around the Al Husn, the club rooms, the stunning views, beaches, lazy river and even take you on a 30c run along the coastline. Whilst there was so much to see and do in the hotel you really couldn’t beat relaxing in one of the many pools or having a refreshing dip in the Indian ocean! \n\nKeep subscribed for part 2 where I head out to Muscat, Nizwa and the mountains where I stay in the exclusive 5* Alila Jabal Akhdar as well as go 4x4 offroading! \n\nTrekTrendy Facebook: facebook.com/TrekTrendy\nTrekTrendy Twitter: twitter.com/TrekTrendy\nTrekTrendy Instagram: Instagram.com/TrekTrendy\nTrekTrendy website: www.TrekTrendy.com\n\n------ Music ------ \nWith thanks to Trap and Base for use of Vass - Rowdy Arabia in the background: http://bit.ly/2avc3U9 \nWhilst every effort has been made to ensure appropriate credit has been given please made sure that if you there are any issues with this or any other background music on my channel to get in contact directly with me to rectify immediately if necessary. \n\n------ Imagery ------ \n\nWith thanks to the Shangri-La and Oman Airlines for use of their photos to further highlight my incredible experience.",source:"youtube",source_id:"xyavu7VlKeQ",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1470688063000)};

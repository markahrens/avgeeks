We enter the terminal and make our way through security before heading airside.  Before long our gate is announced and we make our way to board our aircraft, Embraer E175 G-FBJI.  We take our seat in seat 16D and we are soon cleared to push back and taxi to runway 23L.  We depart after a brief rain shower on a beautiful summer evening.  \n\nAfter takeoff we fly towards Liverpool, then turning northwest towards the Isle of Man where we get some stunning views.  The sun starts to set as we commence our approach into Belfast.  We land shortly behind schedule and taxi into the terminal, disembarking into Belfast City Airport's small terminal building.\n\nAirline: Flybe\nFlight: BE486\nAircraft: Embraer 175 G-FBJC\nFrom: Manchester (MAN)\nTo: Belfast (BHD)\nDeparture: 19:32\nArrival: 20:09\nFlight Time: 0:37\nSeat: 16D\n\n\nTIMELINE\n0:00:06 Outside Manchester Airport Terminal 3, entering the terminal, walking to security\n0:01:37 After security, walking to departure lounge\n0:05:04 Walking to gate\n0:09:38 Boarding aircraft\n0:19:42 Cabin view\n0:25:14 Welcome PA from captain Guy Appleton\n0:38:32 Pushback and engine start\n0:43:13 Taxi to runway 23L\n0:56:28 Takeoff from runway 23L\n1:04:33 Cabin view\n1:14:15 Isle of Man\n1:19:11 Cabin view\n1:26:38 Approach to runway 22 at Belfast City\n1:33:13 Landing at runway 22\n1:39:02 Disembarking aircraft, walk through terminal\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"XZmi-kKOjmE",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1532696411000)};

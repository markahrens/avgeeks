const data = {name:"Air Georgian (Air Canada Express) Beechcraft 1900D | Final Calgary Operations",description:"For years now, the smallest member of Air Canada's fleet has been, not a Dash 8 as you'd think, but a Beechcraft 1900D. These aircraft, operated by Air Georgian, flew for Air Canada Express to a myriad of destinations, from Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal, to smaller cities nearby.\n\nAt the height of their operation here in Calgary, the Beech 1900s flew to Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Cranbrook, and Red Deer. In recent months though, Air Canada has been slowly, and quietly, winding down the use of these aircraft all across the country.\n\nCalgary was the last hub for these unique aircraft, but in February 2019, Air Canada announced that they would be terminating their contract with Air Georgian. Georgian had been flying the Beech 1900s out of Calgary, and a fleet of CRJ-200s out of Toronto-Pearson.\n\nApril 30th was the last day of passenger flights for these aircraft out of Calgary, and seeing as I have no true spotting videos of them from my past 6 years as a spotter (shame on me, really), I thought it only fitting that I should document the last few commercial flights of the \"mighty Beech\".\n\nBest of luck to the people of Air Georgian, and I hope you enjoy the video.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\n\n#1: GGN7220 YQL-YYC C-GZGA\n\n#2: GGN7233 YYC-YXH C-GZGA\n\n#3: GGN7222 YQL-YYC C-GMGA\n\n#4: GGN7236 YXH-YYC C-GZGA\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",source:"youtube",source_id:"j9TBbjp5E34",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1556715607000)};

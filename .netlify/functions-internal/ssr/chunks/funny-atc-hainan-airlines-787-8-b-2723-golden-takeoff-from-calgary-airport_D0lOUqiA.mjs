const data = {name:"Funny ATC - Hainan Airlines 787-8 [B-2723] Golden Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Hainan now operates their Boeing 787-8 into Calgary (which I've strangely never uploaded!) three times a week, replacing the A330 service which stopped in August of last year, but is now slated to restart in September. It's rare to see Hainan in golden hour, but they had a mechanical issue forcing them to delay departure several hours. There's also some slightly awkward ATC as they, out of the blue, request 8 minutes before they can depart, followed 10 seconds later by \"we're ready now\". Kinda funny to hear. Hope you enjoy this golden hour departure of this beautiful 787!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Hainan Airlines (CHH/HU)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B\nRegistration: B-2723\nRoute: YYC-PEK\nCallsign: Hainan 7978 heavy\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: September 17, 2016\nLocal time: 1900\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/B2723\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"uY3vCMPL95c",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1490143876000)};

Almost unheard of in Europe now, this was a great opportunity to capture one of these rare beasts. \n\nThis was a great flight - though the 04:15 start did not help! Props to Delta for retaining at least some complimentary service in economy. I love flying rear engined aircraft and the 717 didn't disappoint, with its 3-2 seating in economy. Just a shame Delta doesn't give lounge access to Skyteam elite fliers travelling domestically, but that's Delta for you...\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

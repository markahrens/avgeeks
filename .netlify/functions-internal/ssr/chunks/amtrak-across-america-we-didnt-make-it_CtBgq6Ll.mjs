We enjoyed some of America’s most breathtaking scenery along the way before arriving in Chicago, but now it’s time to complete our rail journey across the continent to get home to Greensboro, NC. \n\nToday, we’ll leave Chicago for the 24 hour journey to Washington, DC onboard Amtrak’s Cardinal Train. The Cardinal passes through Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, and DC. We’ll travel through the very heart of Appalachia and the Valley of Virginia along the way to our nation’s capital. \n\nFrom there, we’ll spend eight more hours on the Carolinian for our final leg home to Greensboro.\n\nAll in, that’s 80 hours or more than three days! Well, at least that was our plan.\n\nOur 24 hours on the Cardinal would be spent in an Amtrak Viewliner II Bedroom, which we’ll explore in depth in this video. We'll even offer an Amtrak food review.\n\nUnfortunately, an Amtrak Delay got in the way of our plans and we had to change them at the last minute. Watch the video to find out what happened on this Amtrak Adventure!\n\nTrain travel in USA isn't always perfect and we'll show you exactly what we did when our plans didn't work out. We'll give you some train travel tips along the way to make the most of your Amtrak train trip.\n\nWe made the most of our delayed train, even though in meant we couldn’t achieve our goal of traveling by train across the USA.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:33 Amtrak Metropolitan Lounge in Chicago\n2:22 Boarding Amtrak Cardinal\n4:37 Amtrak Viewliner II Measurements\n7:12 Bad News Begins\n8:42 A New Plan Emerges\n\nDon’t miss our Amtrak Empire Buidler Trip\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teN-Y1wAu78&t=1147s\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nHere are my other Train Videos:\nhttp://Jeb.Flights/Trains\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMUSIC:\nFor Some Time (Instrumental Version) - Daniel Gunnarsson\nDown by the Creek - Victor Lunderg\nDeep and Abiding (Instrumental Version) - Victor Lundberg\nInto Pieces (Instrumental Version) - Amos Noah\nOn the Road - Isobelle Walton\nWaterslide (Tribute Version) - Loving Caliber",source:"youtube",source_id:"5g4IC2zmN0I",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1679151603000)};

const data = {name:"Lufthansa 747-8 UPPER DECK Business Class | Washington, DC - Frankfurt",description:"Is there anything more romantic than a flight on a Boeing 747?! Well, I recently flew UPSTAIRS in Lufthansa Business Class on one of Lufthansa's Boeing 747-8's (D-ABYF)! It's the first leg of my amazing journey from Washington, DC to Kenya's Masai Mara. Over the next several weeks, I'll be sharing more trip reports!\n\nThis Lufthansa 747-8 Business Class upper deck experience was really amazing. Watch this video to see what made the trip so special. And there was a lot! Not only was sitting on the 747 upper deck in business class amazing, but the cabin crew also offered a few extra \"treats\" along the way.\n\nAlong the way, this flight report will include information about the seats, the inflight entertainment, the food, and the cabin crew from this Lufthansa Boeing 747-8 flight! You can even watch the Boeing 747 upper deck take off!\n\nWhat do you think of Lufthansa Business?

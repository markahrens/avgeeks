const data = {name:"First 787 at YYC! Air Canada 787-8 Dreamliner [C-GHPQ] Touch and Go at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"History in the making! This is the very first time that a Boeing 787 has touched down in Calgary, let alone anywhere in Alberta, after arriving on a ferry flight from YYZ. I went spotting for 4 hours yesterday just to catch this thing, and she did 3 touch and goes and a full stop landing at YYC. Of course, I caught all of them, how could I not? ;) I hope you enjoy the video, and stay tuned for lots more 787 action in the coming days!\n\nThanks for watching!

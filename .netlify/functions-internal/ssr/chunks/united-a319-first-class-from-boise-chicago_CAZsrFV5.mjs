What changes have come to the Friendly Skies?\n\n0:00 Welcome and Introduction\n0:35 BOI Airport Tour\n3:06 Boarding United First Class\n4:14 Taxi and Take-off\n5:09 United Airlines Inflight Entertainment\n5:34 United Airlines First Class Catering\n6:37 Views of the USA!\n7:02 Final Thoughts\n\nThe flight from Boise to Chicago was three hours long, which meant it allowed me to experience nearly all of the service they provide in 2020 on domestic first class flights. From the A319 First Class Seat, the inflight entertainment, the First Class Catering, and the service, we’ll look at all of it so you can decide whether you’d like to try United Airlines First Class.\n\nThe trip begins at the Boise International Airport and ends 1400 miles away at Chicago’s O’Hare International. It was a pretty fun trip with the highlight being the views out the window – a treat available to anyone lucky enough to book a window seat.\n\nAlthough United does not block middle seats, the overall experience in First Class was great. But, why don’t you watch this video about United Airlines First Class to decide for yourself!\n\nAirportsREVEALED™:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFeqB0_phJSzjYPxTUDaQ8xNC\n\nHere’s a link to the unedited take-off and landing footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/n5MhVssjmWM\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMUSIC:\nAmber Lights – Chill Cole\nSidney – Luwaks\nHonesty – Hallman\nFrom the Cliffside – Tape Machines",source:"youtube",source_id:"it-QLsjS_IY",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1605971701000)};

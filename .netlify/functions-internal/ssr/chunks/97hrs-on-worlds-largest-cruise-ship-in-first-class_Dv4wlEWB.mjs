Free shipping for CA, US, AU, JP, TW, KR, SGP.\n\nToday I’m getting onboard the worlds largest cruise ship, Wonder of the Seas. Operated by Royal Caribbean, I’ll be exploring every aspect of the experience from one of the very best first class suites onboard, to the various dining and the incredible activities you can enjoy. Ice skating, to broadway shows, to taking a zip line across the ship..it’s all possible! \n\nAs usual, I paid in full for this experience as a regular guest. Royal Carribean had no idea I was coming, so I can offer a honest and non bias account of the experience. I explain fully in the video, and whilst we had a brilliant time there were some drawbacks, and areas for improvement especially at this price point. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:48 - Suite tour\n6:10 - Wonderland\n12:48 - Pools\n17:20 - Dinner\n22:08 - Central Park\n26:25 - Cost",source:"youtube",source_id:"5wGhlwJef-Q",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1690150131000)};

As the gateway to – and from – our nation’s capital, foreign flag carriers put their best foot forward for passengers…even now.\n\nLounge Hopping is one of my favorite pastimes.

You’ll visit the Lufthansa Senator Lounge, the Turkish Airlines Lounge, and the Air France-KLM Lounge.\n\nWe’ll check out the food on offer, the available drinks, and even the views from these exclusive clubs at Dulles Airport.\n\nBut, perhaps best of all, I’ll share exactly how you can enter lounges just like these all over the world usually reserved for VIP’s no matter your airline, class of service, or destination.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:23 Getting Around Dulles Airport\n2:07 Lufthansa Senator Lounge at Dulles Airport\n3:15 Turkish Airlines Lounge at Dulles Airport\n4:41 Air France KLM Lounge at Dulles Airport\n5:41 How to Access Lounges\n\nHere’s my Washington DCA Airport Video:\nhttps://youtu.be/rlKckgYFqPU\n\nAirports Revealed:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFeqB0_phJSzjYPxTUDaQ8xNC\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n \nPriority Pass Lounges at IAD:\nhttps://www.prioritypass.com/en/lounges/usa/washington-dc-dulles-intl\n\nMusic:\nBryant Bark – Dylan Sitts\nDungeness Crab – Margareta\nDer Volle Stube – Trabant 33\nDesert Mist - Rune Dale\nLike In France – Trabant 33\nBe Free With Me (Instrumental Version) – Siine*\nThe Street Performer (Sting) – Martin Gauffin\n\n*If anybody reads this and leaves a comment saying “This Song is from your ____ video” with the blank filled in correctly, I’ll give you a heart!",source:"youtube",source_id:"IQ4sfru9b3I",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1621180814000)};

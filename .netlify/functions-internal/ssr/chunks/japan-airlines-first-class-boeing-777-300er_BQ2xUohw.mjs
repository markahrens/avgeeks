Of course I didn't pay anywhere near that.\n\nI departed LAX on JAL's First Class on their Boeing 777-300ER , a flight which takes between 11-12 hours. Today I have one of their First Class Suites and I'm going to show you around it. From the food right through to how to suite turns into a comfortable bed. JAL First Class is a great experience especially on such a long flight where you're able to indulge in all the amenities on offer.\n\nI paid $100 for my JAL First Class ticket by using Avios miles to redeem.

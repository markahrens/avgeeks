const data = {name:"Diversion/Emergency Landing! | Flybe/Loganair | Glasgow to Glasgow | DHC6 Twin Otter (with ATC)",description:"A full length full flight video in real time with Loganair/Flybe, from Glasgow to Barra with a diversion and emergency landing back in Glasgow, onboard DeHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter G-HIAL operating flight BE6851 on August 29 2016.\n\n**Every moment of the flight included from outside the airport at Glasgow, to returning to the airport and exiting Glasgow airport again.  ATC included for the entire flight**\n\nThis was a rare flight that did not go to plan!  The plan was to fly to Barra to land on the beach, spend a few hours there and head back to Glasgow.  \n\nOur video begins outside the terminal at Glasgow on a beautiful morning.  We head through the airport to the Loganair lounge, where we board our Twin Otter after a short delay.\n\nWe enjoy a power back from the gate, before we taxi out to runway 24 for departure to the west.  We make a powerful take off from runway 24, climbing out over the beautiful Scottish countryside.  However we encounter a problem around 10 minutes into the flight with the generator on the left engine.  We make a sweeping left turn to head immediately back to Glasgow, as Glasgow ATC ask us whether we have an emergency or if it will be a normal approach and landing.  We get vectors back for immediate landing on runway 24 at Glasgow, where we thankfully land uneventually and taxi to the same stand we departed previously!\n\nAfter being offered refreshments, we are told that the flight to Barra has been cancelled, and therefore we have to return to the check in desk to get a refund or rebooked.  We walk back through the terminal to the check in area where we are able to get a refund for both flights.\n\n0:00:03  Outside Glasgow Airport, entering airport to check in hall\n0:00:46  Walking to security from check in hall\n0:02:27  Security\n0:03:31  After security, walking to departure lounge\n0:06:47  Overview of departure lounge\n0:06:55  Aircraft on the ramp\n0:07:05  Walking to departure gates 1-12\n0:11:12  Walking down steps to Loganair lounge at Gate 1\n0:11:45  Overview of Loganair lounge\n0:12:56  Boarding aircraft across ramp\n0:17:20  Cabin overview\n0:17:49  Doors closed and safety demonstration by First Officer\n0:19:49  ATC: Start and route clearance to Barra\n0:25:43  ATC clearance to power back and taxi from stand, power back from stand\n0:26:50  Taxi to runway 24\n0:30:14  Line up and take off runway 24\n0:36:11  Cabin overview\n0:36:53  Cabin overview\n0:44:57  Contacting Glasgow Approach to commence divert to Glasgow\n0:47:29  Cabin overview\n0:45:33  Turning back to airport, Approach asks if this will be a normal approach and landing\n0:47:28  Cabin overview\n0:51:48  First Officer announces that we are returning to Glasgow due to a technical problem\n0:59:30  Contacting Glasgow Tower, final approach to runway 24\n1:06:52  Back on stand at Glasgow, First Officer welcomes us back to Glasgow and explains we had a generator problem with the left engine that they did not want to take to Barra\n1:07:51  Disembarking aircraft back into gate\n1:10:11  Refreshments provided by Loganair\n1:11:30  Flight cancelled, instructed to return to check in area\n1:11:50  Walking back through airport and exiting the terminal\n\nAirline:  Flybe/Loganair \nFlight:  BE6851\nAircraft: DeHavilland Viking Twin Otter G-HIAL\nFrom:  Glasgow (GLA)\nTo:  Barra (BRR) (Diverted to Glasgow)\nDeparture:  10:43\nArrival:  11:13\nFlight Time:  00:30\nSeat:  7A\nFlight Path:  https://goo.gl/pp4Sx4\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

const data = {name:"9 Heavy Arrivals on Runway 24R at Los Angeles International Airport",description:"In November 2018, just before my flight above LAX with Star Helicopters, I paid a visit to one of the best-known locations in the world for plane spotting, the In-N-Out Burger next to runway 24R at the second busiest airport in the United States! \n\nThis video includes just under an hour's worth of heavies, coincidentally all Boeing, arriving from various destinations, including a now-retired KLM Boeing 747-400, specifically PH-BFB, which was the oldest operating 747-400 in the world at the time of filming, and something I didn't actually realize until editing the video. 'Bangkok' is slated to be preserved at the Corendon hotel in Amsterdam. (Too bad it's one letter off and a few months too late :/) Enjoy these 9 heavies from this classic location!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT ABOVE LAX: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvYlYGaGay0\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\n#1: United Airlines B787-9 Dreamliner N27959 \nFrom Tokyo-Narita (RJAA/NRT) as UAL33\n\n#2: Air China B777-39L(ER) B-2047\nFrom Beijing-Capital (ZBAA/PEK) as CCA987\n\n#3: Japan Airlines B787-8 Dreamliner JA829J\nFrom Osaka-Kansai (RJBB/KIX) as JAL60\n\n#4: United Airlines B757-224(WL) N26123\nFrom Washington-Dulles (KIAD/IAD) as UAL2154\n\n#5: Air New Zealand B777-219(ER) ZK-OKH\nFrom Auckland (AKL) as ANZ6\n\n#6: Delta Air Lines 767-432(ER) N834MH\nFrom New York-Kennedy (KJFK/JFK) as DAL568\n\n#7: Delta Air Lines 757-351(WL) N587NW\nFrom Atlanta (KATL/ATL) as DAL1172\n\n#8: KLM Royal Dutch B747-406 PH-BFB\nFrom Amsterdam-Schiphol (EHAM/AMS) as KLM601\n\n#9: Air Canada B787-9 Dreamliner C-FVLU\nFrom Toronto-Pearson (CYYZ/YYZ) as ACA787\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"7Rv_ZqO0flM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1547249270000)};

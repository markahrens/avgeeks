Although this past winter they were a regular sight on Fridays while the 789 operated 5 other weekly flights, they were often seen replacing the 789 on equipment changes. This is one such event, which took place after the regular winter 772 service ended. ATC is included, enjoy this special equipment swap, though not as awesome as when KLM sends the 77Ws ;)\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM/KL)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-200ER (B772)\nAircraft Name: \"Ferrara City\"\nLivery: Old\nEngines: 2x GE90-94B\nRegistration: PH-BQF\nRoute: Amsterdam (AMS) - Calgary (YYC) - Amsterdam (AMS)\nCallsign: KLM 677/678 heavy\nRunway used: 17L, 17R\nDate filmed: April 29, 2017\nLocal time: 1300, 1500\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/PHBQF\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"mBpImE9BI7Y",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1500825606000)};

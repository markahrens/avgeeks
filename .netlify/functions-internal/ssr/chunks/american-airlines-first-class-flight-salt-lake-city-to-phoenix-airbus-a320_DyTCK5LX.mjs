It was a fine morning for flying, and the video includes all phases of the flight, takeoff, landing and cruise. There's also some geography tidbits for you too, as usual. Catering is the standard AA domestic First Class offer (not much!). \n\nThis flight took place on an ex-US Airways A320 which, although repainted, hadn't been refurbished inside. So it still had the old US armchairs! I do miss US Airways....\n\nEnjoy the video, and leave me a comment!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"bme7JTp1BYg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1473495499000)};

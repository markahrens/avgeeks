const data = {name:"American Airlines MD-82 [N954U] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"The American Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-80 served YYC during the winter for many years, but MD-80 service stopped permanently to be replaced by an A319 on the carrier's daily flight to Dallas. Last Sunday though, YYC spotters were treated to a rare equipment swap from the regular A319 to the beautiful mad dog! It was pretty windy, as the tower said, 12 gusting 18 knots. Check out the aircraft bouncing around on the taxi because of that. Though all this is interesting, the aircraft has a sobering history. On November 22, 1994, this aircraft was operating TWA flight 427 STL-DEN when, on the takeoff roll, it struck a Cessna 441 and killed both of its occupants. Read the Wikipedia page below for more information. I hope you enjoy the video.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_427\n\nThanks for watching!

const data = {name:"FedEx Feeder (Morningstar) Cessna 208B Grand Caravan Landing and Departing Calgary Airport",description:"A not-so-common sight here in Calgary! Morningstar Air Express operates 8 Cessna 208s for FedEx Canada, generally between smaller cities. They're not a frequent visitor to Calgary though, as we just get their 757s in FedEx colours as well as a FedEx-operated A300 to Memphis. This Cessna 208B flew in from Vancouver, making a brief stop for fuel in Calgary, before heading out to Winnipeg just a few minutes later. Hope you enjoy this small yet unique visitor in action, with ATC included!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Morningstar Air Express (MAL)\nAircraft: Cessna 208B Grand Caravan (C208)\nFlight Number: MAL7940\nLivery: FedEx Feeder\nEngines: 1x Pratt and Whitney PT6A-114A\nRegistration: C-FEXF \nRoute: Vancouver (YVR) - Calgary (YYC) - Winnipeg (YWG)\nCallsign: MORNINGSTAR 7940\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: July 14, 2018\nLocal time: 1400\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"iE3cQWvgifI",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1532448006000)};

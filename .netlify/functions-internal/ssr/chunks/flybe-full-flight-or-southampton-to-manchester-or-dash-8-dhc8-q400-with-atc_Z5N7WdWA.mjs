const data = {name:"Flybe Full Flight | Southampton to Manchester | Dash 8 DHC8-Q400 **With ATC**",description:"A full length flight with Flybe from Southampton (SOU) to Manchester (MAN) onboard DHC8-Q400 G-ECOE, operating flight BE863 on December 31 2015.\n\n*Every moment of the flight included, as well as ATC for the entire flight!*\n**NEW: Real time flight map with altitude!  Starts at 0:15:58 http://inflightvideo.tv/a/5\n\nThe video begins as we enter the terminal at Southampton, and head through security to the small departure lounge.  It is soon time for boarding and we walk out to the aircraft and take our seat in seat 7D.  We receive our route clearance from Southampton Tower and soon get our push and start clearance.  We backtrack down runway 20 for departure, holding short for a helicopter departing the airfield.  Once he is gone we are cleared for takeoff.  After takeoff we turn on a north-easterly heading, towards London, climbing to 20,000ft.  After a left turn we continue north on a beautiful clear morning, getting a great view of the cities of Milton Keynes, Northampton, Leicester and Derby, and a great view of East Midlands Airport.  We commence our approach over the beautiful Peak District which is again under clear skies, turning over Stockport for our final approach.  We are cleared to land on runway 23R, and touchdown early, taxying into Terminal 3.\n\nAirline:  Flybe\nFlight:  BE863\nAircraft:  Bombardier DHC8-Q400 G-ECOE\nFrom:  Southampton (SOU)\nTo: Manchester (MAN)\nDeparture:  10:33\nArrival:  11:16\nFlight Time:  00:43\nSeat:  7D\nFlight path: http://goo.gl/5ZdnO6\n\n********************************************************************\nPlease subscribe, comment and like, and follow me for regular full flight and behind the scenes videos!\n\nFacebook:  facebook.com/inflightvideo\nTwitter: twitter.com/inflightvideo\nG+: plus.google.com/+inflightvideo\nInstagram: instagram.com/inflightvideo\n********************************************************************\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

const data = {name:"Timelapse Flight | Dublin to Philadelphia | American Airlines Boeing 757-200",description:"A timelapse full flight with American Airlines, from Dublin to Philadelphia, onboard Boeing 757-200 N936UW operating flight AA723 on April 1 2016.\n\nFull flight in real time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1OIdiKgqrA\n\nOur journey begins at Dublin Airport's Terminal 2, where, after a short delay due to an electrical fault, we push back for departure from runway 10.  Once airborne, we head across Ireland before beginning our transatlantic crossing, flying at a lower altitude of 28,000ft initially due to heavy turbulence at higher levels.  We climb in steps up to FL340, before we enter a large area of further heavy turbulence which leaves the fasten seatbelt sign on for the remainder of the flight. We head down the east-coast of the US passing Boston and New England, before the cloud clears shortly before coasting in near to Atlantic City.  We then get a stunning view of New Jersey and Philadelphia as we get closer to the airport, finally touching down some 1h45m late.\n\nVideo taken from seat 8F.\n\nAirline:  American Airlines\nFlight:  AA723\nAircraft:  Boeing 757-200 N936UW\nFrom:  Dublin (DUB)\nTo:  Philadelphia (PHL)\nDeparture:  12:47\nArrival:  15:41\nFlight Time:  07:54\nSeat:  8F\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/p7ObxH\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

KLM is retiring all F70s by the end of 2017. Join me as I visit the Crown Lounge at Amsterdam Schiphol, take a very, very long walk to the bus gates, and board PH-KZU at the “Fokker Farm” (an affectionate name for the huge remote apron where KLM Cityhopper aircraft park).\n\nFlying time (takeoff to landing) on this flight was just 30 minutes; taxi time was nearly 20 minutes! We used AMS’s “Polderbaan” runway, which is located a considerable distance from the central terminal at AMS.\n\nEnjoy the silky-smooth flying conditions on this very quiet aircraft; a fine, no-nonsense flight into Dusseldorf’s airport. Don’t forget to leave a comment and thumbs up!\n\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTHE LAST TIME I WAS IN AMSTERDAM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3IoyWGhoaM \n\n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek\n\nMusic: Artificial Music – And So It Begins\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",source:"youtube",source_id:"__aREvsKI2g",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1486307319000)};

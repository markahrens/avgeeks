const data = {name:"Swiss Business Class Full Flight | Zurich to Luxembourg | Avro RJ100 (with ATC)",description:"A full length full flight video in real time with Swiss, in business class from Zurich to Luxembourg, onboard Avro RJ100 HB-IYQ operating flight LX754 on July 29 2016.\n\n**Every moment of the flight included from airport to airport. ATC for full flight.**\n\nOur flight begins with a run to the gate in the terminal at Zurich, as our inbound flight was late meaning I almost missed the connection!  Fortunately we arrive at the gate just in time, as they are starting to board the flight.\n\nWe take the bus out to our waiting aircraft, Avro RJ100 HB-IYQ, and board the aircraft to take our seat in row 2, in business class.\n\nWe are served a preflight drink of water, much needed after my sprint across the airport, and we are soon on our way with the aircraft less than 50% full.\n\nWe get our clearance to taxi and we make our way out to runway 28, taking our place in the line.  We are then treated to a beautiful departure from Zurich, getting a view of both engines spooling up on the right wing.\n\nDuring the short flight we are served a snack for lunch, consisting of small pastry and some sort of salty compote.  \n\nIt isn't long before we commence our approach into Luxembourg, getting vectors from ATC for the ILS approach to runway 24.  We enjoy a beautiful approach across Luxembourg before a smooth touchdown on schedule in Luxembourg. \n\nAfter the flight we disembark through the jetbridge, into the modern terminal.  Once we're through the airport we emerge onto the street into a beautiful sunny summer's day in Luxembourg.\n\n\nKey moments in flight:\n\n0:00:03  Running through terminal to gate A53 at Zurich after our late incoming flight!\n0:03:22  At Gate A53, having traversed Zurich Airport in less than 5 minutes!\n0:04:13  Boarding the bus to the remote stand\n0:05:29  Bus ride to the remote stand\n0:09:11  Boarding the aircraft through the front steps, taking our seat in 2F\n0:12:51  Pre-departure bottle of water and wipe\n0:14:41  Welcome announcement from flight deck\n0:15:47  Overview of business class cabin\n0:16:52  Safety announcement\n0:23:58  ATC: Route clearance to Luxembourg\n0:25:14  ATC: Request startup clearance, advised of delay before startup\n0:26:39  ATC: Startup approved\n0:31:48  ATC: Requesting taxi clearance, cleared to taxi behind Air Berlin\n0:39:54  Cabin overview\n0:40:35  ATC: Cleared to line up and wait on runway 28\n0:42:37  Lining up on runway 28\n0:43:11  ATC: Cleared to take off runway 28\n0:44:39  ATC: Contacting departures\n1:00:45  Business class cabin overview\n1:03:04  Main cabin overview\n1:04:12  Business class meal service\n1:04:45  Swiss Chocolate\n1:05:28  Main cabin overview\n1:06:19  Business class coffee service\n1:12:27  ATC: Contacting Luxembourg Approach\n1:23:14  ILS approach for runway 24\n1:25:08  ATC: Cleared to land runway 24\n1:27:17  Landing on runway 25\n1:29:41  Pulling on stand\n1:31:26  Disembarking through forward doors via jetway, walking into terminal and out to street\n1:36:48  Leaving terminal to street\n\nAirline:  Swiss\nFlight:  LX754\nAircraft: Avro RJ100 HB-IYQ\nFrom:  Zurich (ZRH)\nTo:  Luxembourg (LUX)\nDeparture:  13:36\nArrival:  14:22\nFlight Time:  00:46\nSeat:  2F\nFlight Path:  https://goo.gl/3TD8f4\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCameras: \nWindow footage: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nYou need this for the suction mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\nScanner for ATC: Yupiteru MVT-7300\nRecorder for ATC: Olympus VN-741PC http://amzn.to/2fb4Lab\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

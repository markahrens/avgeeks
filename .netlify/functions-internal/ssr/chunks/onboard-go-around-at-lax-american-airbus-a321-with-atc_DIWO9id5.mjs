const data = {name:"Onboard Go-around at LAX: American Airbus A321 (With ATC)",description:"Onboard view of a late go-around at Los Angeles (LAX), onboard an American Airlines Airbus A321T operating flight AA171 from New York's JFK on September 13 2015.  Includes ATC for the entire landing and go-around.\n\nWe commence our final approach for runway 24L, and whilst on short final (half mile) ATC clears another aircraft to enter and take off from the same runway.  We initiate the go-around as we approach the threshold, making an immediate climbing right turn out over the bay to commence our second approach and landing.  This time, we land safely on runway 25R and vacate to the right.\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

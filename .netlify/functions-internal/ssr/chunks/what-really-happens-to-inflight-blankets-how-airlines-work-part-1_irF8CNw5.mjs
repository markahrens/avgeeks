const data = {name:"What REALLY Happens to Inflight Blankets? How Airlines Work Part 1",description:"Have you ever wondered what happens once all the passengers disembark after a long haul flight?  What happens to the aircraft?  How do they prepare for the next flight and who does all the dishes? And what happens to the used blankets between flights? Let's find out together!\n\nI've been given exclusive behind the scenes access at Qatar Airways to see exactly what makes them tick.  I want to know the secrets behind Qatar Airways' success and what makes them one of the world's leading and fastest growing airlines.\n\nFirst on my list was finding out what happens between flights. In this instance between a 14 hour long-haul flight from Seattle to Doha and a 13 hour long haul flight to Adelaide. \n\nIn never-seen-before footage I was allowed onboard the aircraft after all the passengers had left and was there when the cleaning and catering crews sprung into action.  Their first task was to completely de-Seattle the aircraft by removing all the used meal carts, pillows, blankets, mattresses and rubbish.  The aircraft is then thoroughly cleaned before it is prepared for its next flight, in this case another long-haul leg to Adelaide. \n\nRe-stocking for Adelaide begins with the arrival of a fleet of trucks - carrying 120 fully stocked carts as well as bags and bags of blankets, pillow cases and amenity kits. \n\nWith the new crew boarding an hour before the Adelaide flight was due to depart it was time for me to find out who was doing the dishes.  \n\nAgain I was given exclusive access to how the entire operation of de-stocking and re-stocking an aircraft goes.  The Qatar Aircraft Catering Company's operational centre is the largest single building catering unit in the world at 69,000sq metres.  Not only does it produce over 170,000 meals per day it also processes 7000-8000 dirty carts and does 1.5 million dishes. Every single day. \n\nOn top of that it processes 40 tons of laundry, including 100,000 blankets per day. \n\nThe operation is mind boggling and needs to be seen to believed.  Luckily Qatar Airways gave me, and my camera, a full-access pass and I was able to see every step of the process.  I now understand why Qatar Airways wins so many awards and have a far greater appreciation of exactly how much work and how many people are involved in making these flights possible.  \n\nTo all the unseen heroes working behind the scenes and to everybody at Qatar Airways who helped make this video possible a massive thank you from me and every other passenger.\n\nThis it Part 1 of my Qatar Airways Behind the Scenes video series.  Other episodes will feature their Cargo Operations, the Crew Terminal and the super secretive Integrated Operations Centre. \n\nIf you haven't subscribed yet please consider doing so because these videos will be equally amazing. \n\nThanks for watching and as always happy travels\n\nCheers\n\nDennis\n\nLINKS TO OTHER VIDEOS MENTIONED:\n\nQatar Airways Q-Suite Review - The Quad Seats:   https://youtu.be/9TvsoFCCGLY\nQatar Airways Q-Suite - As Good As First?  https://youtu.be/Pw5h6rILQ4k \n\n#Qatarbehindthescenes #qatarairways #behindthescenes \n\nThis Qatar Airways Behind the Scenes video covers:\nAirport logistics, airline catering, industrial dishwashing, industrial laundry, Aircraft loading, Aircraft unloading, long haul flight operations, aircraft cleaning, aircraft dressing, aircraft turnaround, \nBoeing 777 Pit-stop\n\n00:00 Introduction\n02:10 Cleaners Board\n03:16 Aircraft Unloading\n04:25 Q-Suite\n05:27 Below the Wing\n05:57 Flight Deck\n06:38 Dressing the Cabin\n07:25 Loading Begins\n08:28 New Crew Boards\n08:55 QACC Introduction\n10:33 Goods Receiving\n11:50 Aircraft Catering Truck Unloading\n13:09 Doing the Dishes\n15:26 Dry Goods and Equipment Packing\n16:50 Drinks!\n17:27 Dirty Laundry!\n18:35 Clean Laundry\n20:11 Staging Area\n20:39 Dispatch\n22:01 Boarding QR914 to Adelaide",source:"youtube",source_id:"pZesw5CFdq8",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1681032615000)};

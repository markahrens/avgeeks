This airport is known by its code as SEA Airport and is also called Seatac airport. \n\nNo matter what you call it, you'll get a walkthrough of seatac airport and explore behind the scenes of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in order to get a sense of what makes this airport unique.\n\nSEA Airport is one of the fastest growing airports in the world. It’s the hub for not one, but two major airlines, Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines. It’s an international gateway, a logistics and cargo powerhouse. And it does it all on a compact footprint dwarfed by similar airports!\n\nWhile many major hubs can be tens of thousands of acres, SEA Airport is only 2,500 acres! This compact footprint, combined with very busy skies,  makes for a fascinating operation.\n\nIn this video, you’ll see everything from the terminals to the cargo area. You’ll even head out onto an active runway to get a sense of just how complex SEA Airport is!\n\nHere’s a link to the video with Ken and Justin’s career advice:\nhttps://youtu.be/m0VE_GM4cow\n\n#AirportsRevealed is an ongoing series.

Our seat today is 5A, in the business class cabin of this giant aircraft.  Before long we receive our route clearance for our short flight across the Alps to Zurich, and we push back as the enormous GE90 engines roar into life.  We have a short taxi to runwawy 05 before we depart to the east over Lake Geneva.  \n\nWe fly towards Lausanne, climbing to our brief cruising altitude of just 16,000ft.  We head towards Bern and Lucerne getting magnificent views of the Alps beneath us, before entering a brief holding pattern to the west of Zurich.  We are soon cleared for our ILS approach for runway 14, and after a beautiful clear approach we enter a patch of fog over the airport and touch down with near zero visibility!\n\nThumbnail: Matthias Geiger http://www.airplane-pictures.net/photo/743591/hb-jnd-swiss-boeing-777-300er/\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"erCW9SHVDJY",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1488549599000)};

const data = {name:"FIRST CLASS AIRPORT LOUNGE CRAWL - Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, Air Canada & United",description:"Please subscribe to TrekTrendy TV : http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nSo I decided to do something which I don't think has been done before, like a bar crawl but instead, airport 1st class lounges, all in one afternoon!\n\nAfter arriving at London Heathrow and fast tracking security through the dedicated First class / Gold status channel, I started off in the Lufthansa Business class lounge. If you're flying first or hold gold status you can access the coveted Senator first class lounge which of course was my next stop. You basically get given a barcode which you scan to gain access. Both lounges were quite busy, contained some great alcohol selections, as well as some good main courses and tasty deserts. Although due to the amount of people in the lounge I didn't stick around too long. I then walked 10 minutes over to satellite terminal B which contained the other lounges I was set to visit. \n\nNow I headed into the Air Canada maple leaf lounge, which was really quiet. It had a decent manned bar (although no one in attendance when I was present) with some good spirit and wine options. The food was good but I only tried some nachos whilst there. The main point which stood out to me was the bed areas, for those with long layovers, which I thought was really useful. \n\nThirdly I headed over to the lounge opposite, which was the Singapore airlines lounge and the winner of this lounge crawl. This lounge is stunning and one of the best I've been in, worldwide. The food section was great and honestly restaurant standard. In my opinion only to be outdone by the Virgin Upper Class lounge in LHR T3. I had a great Singapore sling cocktail, as well as some butter chicken, spring rolls and a chocolate brownie to finish 5/5 SIA :) \n\nFinally the United Airlines lounge which features the largest bar at Heathrow. There were a few nice areas including the relatively extensive food section but sadly not a contender for the Singapore lounge. However I will say that this wins the best bar, and there were some great cocktails on offer but I opted for a refreshing glass of Champagne to conclude my crawl!\n\nHope this has been useful to you all, and give the video a thumbs up if you've found it interesting and a subscribe to see more! Happy travels guys :) \n\n----- Images -----\n\nThanks to Lufthansa, Air Canada, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines for the photos i've used in my introduction and for their awesome lounges at LHR! \n\n----- Background music -----\n\nRock Angel by Joakim Karud https://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud\nCreative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported— CC BY-SA 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\nMusic provided by Audio Library https://youtu.be/K8eRXvLL7Wo",source:"youtube",source_id:"HR6GZjVhCmo",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1469381331000)};

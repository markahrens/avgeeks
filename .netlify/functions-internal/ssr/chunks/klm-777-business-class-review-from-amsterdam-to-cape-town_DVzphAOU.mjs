const data = {name:"KLM 777 Business Class Review from Amsterdam to Cape Town",description:"In this video, we’ll explore KLM Business Class service deep into Africa. This video highlights KLM Business Class from Amsterdam to Cape Town. We’ll take a thorough tour of the KLM Business Class lounge, known as the KLM Crown Lounge in Amsterdam. The eleven hour flight also gave me plenty of time to experience KLM Business Class service, food, and the seat. I also share the inflight entertainment.\n\nKLM Business Class in the 777 is not quite as amazing as it is on their 787, but these planes are still heavily used by the airline and this video gives you a good idea of what it’s like if you were to fly with KLM Business Class. \n\nAlso, this was an unbelievable flight because it was Captain Ruud van Mil’s retirement trip. This flight to Cape Town was his penultimate flight and there was plenty of celebration! Be sure to watch the video to see the special things the crew – including his son – did to celebrate his final trip.\n\nKLM Business Class on the 777 is not the best in the world, but this video will help you decide whether it would be your preferred method of traveling.

const data = {name:"Asiana Airlines 777-28E/ER [HL7755] Windy Landing at LAX ᴴᴰ",description:"Hey everyone, for today's HAF video we have an Asiana Airlines 777 landing at LAX. It actually wasn't too windy while I was filming the video, but you can see the heavy use of the ailerons by the pilot.. While filming it, I was instantly reminded of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, as I'm sure anybody is whenever they see an Asiana 777. Hope you enjoy the video, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

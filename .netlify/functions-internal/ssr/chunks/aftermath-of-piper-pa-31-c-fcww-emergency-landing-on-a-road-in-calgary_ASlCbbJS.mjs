const data = {name:"Aftermath of Piper PA-31 C-FCWW Emergency Landing on a Road in Calgary",description:"This is definitely not a typical upload. Early in the morning on April 25th, 2018, this Piper PA-31 made an emergency landing in the northbound lanes of 36th Street NE in Calgary, Alberta. The aircraft was flying from Medicine Hat (YXH) to Calgary (YYC), and was on final for runway 35R when the crew reported a fuel pump issue and ended up landing on 36th Street, a bit to the east of the flight path for 35R. The aircraft touched down near Marlborough CTrain Station, hit a light pole, and came to a stop between 12 Ave and 16 Ave NE. All six people on board the aircraft escaped unharmed, and nobody on the ground was injured. This aftermath footage includes a couple views of the aircraft and the damage it sustained, some wreckage from the wing, and some shots of TSB investigators in action.

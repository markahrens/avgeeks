We travel from London Heathrow Airport deep into the heart of Texas, to Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport.\n\nHaving arrived from Stockholm, Sweden, the video takes us through flight connections and up into the British Airways Concorde Room, where I have a private cabana booked for a couple of hours. I also manage a spot of lunch in the dining area, as well as a spa treatment at the Elemis day spa next door.\n\nOur flight was perfect, with an excellent crew who were very attentive and professional. BA sometimes fall short on food, but the dining experience was excellent, with everything presented to me being very tasty indeed.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video!\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTRAINS, ANYONE? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iSjr-5LbaA \n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek \n\nMusic courtesy of Czech Vibes Sound and YouTube Audio Library\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",source:"youtube",source_id:"_O8FpAe-pD0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1500170646000)};

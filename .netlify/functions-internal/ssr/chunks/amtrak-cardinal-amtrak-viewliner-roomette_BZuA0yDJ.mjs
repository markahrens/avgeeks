This video highlights the Amtrak Roomette on the Mighty Cardinal and my experience taking it as part of my trip from Washington, DC to Los Angeles on Amtrak.\n\nThis is the first of two videos documenting this trip across the country by Amtrak. In this first video, I’ll share my experience traveling from Washington, DC to Chicago on the Amtrak Cardinal train in an Amtrak Roomette. \n\nFrom this Amtrak Roomette on the Cardinal, we pass through Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, the steep mountains of West Virginia, the hills of Kentucky, on into Ohio, and Indiana, all before stopping in Illinois. \n\nThis video highlights every aspect of my trip on the Amtrak Cardinal in the Amtrak Roomette, including the Acela Lounge at Washington’s Union Station, the Amtrak Roomette, a well-designed and comfortably private space. I’ll share Amtrak’s meals and the spaces available to passengers throughout the Amtrak Cardinal Viewliner train in an Amtrak Roomette.\n\nI’ll even share a bit of history of the Amtrak Cardinal's route along the way, from the perspective of my Amtrak Roomette.\n\nDon’t miss the second video about the Southwest Chief:\nhttps://youtu.be/eYiMihP0OHU\n\n0:00 Welcome and Overview\n0:59 Union Station\n2:21 Acela Lounge\n2:57 Boarding the Amtrak Cardinal to an Amtrak Roomette\n4:11 Departure (7 minutes late)\n5:55 Amtrak Roomette Tour\n7:41 Amtrak Wifi\n8:29 Amtrak Lunch (Pasta & Meatballs) in my Amtrak Roomette\n10:25 Fresh Air Break in Charlottesville, Virginia\n10:51 Amtrak Cardinal Train Tour\n11:54 Buckingham Branch\n12:46 Entering Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley\n15:22 About White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia\n17:21 Amtrak Dinner (Red Wine Braised Beef)\n18:33 Waking Up in Indiana in my Amtrak Roomette\n19:26 Breakfast in my Amtrak Roomette\n21:06 Next Stop, Chicago!\n21:58 Bloopers\n\nMore Train Videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFepS_ZVMUVMsf43z3FYjn4cc\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMUSIC:\nOpen Your Heart – Briar Edwards\nProgressive Progress – Howard Harper-Barnes\nGive Me (Instrumental Version) – Humble Hey\nPlane To California (Instrumental Version) – Aluvio\nEverything I know – Plain Strolls\nSheridan Square – Constance Calling\nSetllted (Instrumental Version) – Bird of Figment\nGive My All to You (Instrumental Version) -waykap\nNew Light (Instrumental Version) – Sven Karlsson\n¬Humble Abode – George’s Town\nThe Street Performer – The Fly Guy Five",source:"youtube",source_id:"agz6Y6-UaH4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1608390901000)};

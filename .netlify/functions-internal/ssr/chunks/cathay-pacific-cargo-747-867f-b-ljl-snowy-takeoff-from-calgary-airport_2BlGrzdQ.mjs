const data = {name:"Cathay Pacific Cargo 747-867F [B-LJL] Snowy Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Cathay Pacific Cargo in daylight! You don't see this often at all. Here we have one of Cathay Pacific Cargo's two weekly flights departing onto Hong Kong, after arrival from JFK. This flight usually arrives around 3AM and departs at 5AM so daylight action is pretty rare. ATC communications are included with captions. Enjoy the sound of those 4 GEnx engines screaming and the sheer amount of snow being blasted off the sides of the runways!\n\nThanks for watching!

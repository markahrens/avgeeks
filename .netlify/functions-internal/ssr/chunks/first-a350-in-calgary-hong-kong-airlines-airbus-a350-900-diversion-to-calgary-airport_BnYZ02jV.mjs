const data = {name:"First A350 in Calgary! Hong Kong Airlines Airbus A350-900 Diversion to Calgary Airport",description:"Calgary's first ever A350! Yesterday, January 14th, this Hong Kong Airlines Airbus A350-900 diverted to Calgary due to heavy fog in Vancouver. From what I understand, Hong Kong Airlines isn't certified for CAT III operations in Canada yet, hence their diversion to Calgary when the minimums prevented them from landing in YVR.\n\nAfter landing in YYC at 1115 local time, the crew took on fuel, and waited a bit longer for conditions to improve, until they timed out. The crew operating the outbound flight from Vancouver were then flown here and the aircraft was on its way, 9 hours after landing here in Calgary.\n\nQuite the crummy situation for passengers, but for spotters, our first A350 visit was quite the memorable one! This video features B-LGC under tow from gate 76 to gate 37, as passengers went through customs and the leg to Vancouver was treated as a domestic flight, and then taxiing and taking off from runway 35L finally on their way to Vancouver. ATC is included throughout, enjoy my take on Calgary's first A350 visit!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Hong Kong Airlines (CRK/HX)\nAircraft: Airbus A350-941 (A359)\nFlight Number: HX80\nEngines: 2x RR Trent XWB-84\nRegistration: B-LGC\nRoute: Hong Kong (HKG) - diverted to Calgary (YYC) - Vancouver (YVR)\nCallsign: BAUHINIA 080 heavy \nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: January 14, 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"pq571u28S7c",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1547560810000)};

const data = {name:"Air Transat A330-343 [C-GTSD] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Another old clip I found on my hard drive, shot in April 2015. Not sure why I never posted it, but here it is. Air Transat's A330-300s are a rare sight in Calgary, as we primarily get their -200s along with the A310s and 738s. Here we have C-GTSD, one of Air Transat's four A330-300s taxiing up close on Romeo and departing runway 35R for London-Gatwick. Since then, I've seen C-GTSD twice, once in Vancouver and again in Montreal last year. ATC is included, enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Transat (TSC/TS)\nAircraft: Airbus A330-300 (A333)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x RR Trent 772B-60 \nRegistration: C-GTSD\nRoute: YYC-LGW\nCallsign: Transat 730 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nLocal Time: 1800\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGTSD\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"6WEieyU3N2w",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1487202178000)};

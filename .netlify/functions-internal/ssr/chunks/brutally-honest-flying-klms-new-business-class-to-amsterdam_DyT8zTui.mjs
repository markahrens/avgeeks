const data = {name:"BRUTALLY HONEST: Flying KLM’s NEW Business Class to Amsterdam",description:"Head to https://squarespace.com/trektrendy to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain using code TREKTRENDY\n\nToday I’m flying KLMs new Business Class, onboard their 787-10 from Toronto all the way over to Amsterdam, in The Netherlands. I’ll be offering a brutally honest review of the experience, so as usual you’ll now for sure if this is a good or bad product to fly. This trip report will cover the business class lounge at Toronto Pearson International airports, through to the onboard service, the bed, dining and there’s a one off in todays video. We’ll be taking a look at the not seen before, crew rest areas - the secretive upstairs of this 787-10 (maybe you didn’t realise there was such an area before!).\n\nOf course being brutally honest, I won’t be holding back on some elements, such as their other plane types, the backbone of the fleet the Boeing 777. This features an outdated and uncompetitive Business Class which I’d avoid. There are also some factors I mention in the video to consider when flying this specific, brand new Business Class. \n\nDo let me know what you think down below. Would you, or have you flown fly KLM before in their international premium cabins?",source:"youtube",source_id:"0B8ephSNl4E",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1643577162000)};

We'll highlight the benefits of Delta Comfort and also discuss how to get a seat in Delta Air Lines' premium economy cabin.\n\nThe flight I took was between Atlanta and Bermuda so that means, in addition to seeing the seat and amenities of the Delta Comfort Premium Economy cabin, there are stunning views of Bermuda's beautiful ocean and beaches (be sure to watch to the very end!).\n\nA Delta Comfort Review isn't complete without talking about all of the benefits that go along with the more expensive ticket, so we'll be sure to highlight them in the video.\n\nDelta Comfort is also known as Delta Comfort+ and Delta Economy Comfort. They're all names for Delta Air Lines' entrant in the Premium Economy category. \n\nSo, please let me know in the comments section: After watching this Delta Comfort Review, do you think Premium Economy is worth the money?\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nA Walk in the Clouds 1 - Gavin Luke\nLike a Snowflake - Gavin Luke",source:"youtube",source_id:"m3rC33VAnfg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1534496570000)};

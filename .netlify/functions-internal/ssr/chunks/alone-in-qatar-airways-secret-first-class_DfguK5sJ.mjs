const data = {name:"ALONE in Qatar Airways' SECRET First Class",description:"Qatar Airways has a first class product you won't find ANYWHERE on their publicity - for good reason! Superb ex-Cathay Pacific Boeing 777-300ERs are operating for Qatar from Doha to Male, Istanbul, Kuwait and also to Hong Kong. The Istanbul route is perfect to get a taste for this excellent and opulent regional first class product, costing me just 52,500 Avios to book - not bad for a one off splurge!

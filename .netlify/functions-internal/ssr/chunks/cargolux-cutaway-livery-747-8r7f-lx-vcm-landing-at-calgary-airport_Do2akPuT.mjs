I'm very, VERY happy to have finally caught it, and with such perfect conditions too. The lighting was just phenomenal. Here we have LX-VCM, Cargolux's \"Cutaway\" livery 747-8F landing at Calgary International Airport, taxiing, and sitting on the apron opening the nose. ATC is included, hope you enjoy this very special catch!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Cargolux Airlines Int'l (CLX/CV)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-8F (B748)\nAircraft Name: City of Redange-sur-Attert \nLivery: \"Cutaway\"\nEngines: 4x GEnx-2B67\nRegistration: LX-VCM\nRoute: Luxembourg-Findel (LUX) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Cargolux 772 heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: May 22 2016\nLocal time: 2100\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/LXVCM\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"mveyzT23Xlg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1495518773000)};

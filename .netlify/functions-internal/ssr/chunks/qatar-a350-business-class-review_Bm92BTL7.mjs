The Qatar A350 business class seat just ticks all the boxes - it's practical, comfortable, gives a good level of privacy and converts into a fully flat and COMFORTABLE bed.  \n\nThis flight review was filmed on QR914 from Doha to Adelaide, Australia.  It is a 12 hour flight so plenty of time to indulge in Qatar's inflight service and put their product to the test. \n\nThe Qatar A350 business class flight review covers Hamad International Airport in Doha, the lounge, boarding, take off, the Qatar business class seat, inflight dining and entertainment.  I also cover the Qatar business class amenities kit and pjs.\n\nFor more flight reviews including Qantas, Emirates, Cathay Pacific, Etihad, Turkish Airlines, LATAM and Baltic Air please check out my channel. \n\nFlight:     QR914\nRoute:    Doha to Adelaide - 12 hours\nWhen:    February 2017\nAircraft:  Airbus A350-900   registration A7ALC\nSeat:       9K\nCamera:  Sony FDR-AXP55\n\nUpcoming reviews:\n\nQatar A320 Business Class\nRwandair 737 Economy Class",source:"youtube",source_id:"OTES-mrDJd4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1490177589000)};

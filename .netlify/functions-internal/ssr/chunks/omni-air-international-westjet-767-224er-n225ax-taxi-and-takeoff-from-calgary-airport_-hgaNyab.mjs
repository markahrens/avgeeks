Due to the delays in delivering and certifying the 767s, WestJet was unable to get the ETOPS certification needed to fly from Alberta to Hawaii in time. As a result, they needed to lease a pair of aircraft from another airline (ironically, the whole reason they bought widebodies in the first place). These two aircraft came from Omni Air International, A 767-300ER (video link below) and a 767-200ER (featured in this video). As we all know, passenger 767-200s aren't common these days, so I was quite happy to get this shot of her. Great way to kick off 2016! ATC included with captions, hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!

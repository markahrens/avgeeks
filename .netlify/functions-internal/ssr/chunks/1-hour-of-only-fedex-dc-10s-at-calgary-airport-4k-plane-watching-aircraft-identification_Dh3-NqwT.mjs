const data = {name:"1 HOUR of ONLY FedEx DC-10s at Calgary Airport! 4K Plane Watching, Aircraft Identification",description:"From late August until the end of December, FedEx decided to switch their weekday flights between Memphis and Calgary, Canada, from the usual 767 Freighters to their McDonnell Douglas MD-10s!\n\nThe MD-10 is essentially, the DC-10 but with a modernized 2-crew flight deck that's virtually identical to the MD-11. This conversion allows for some substantial cost savings, by allowing pilots to fly both the MD-10 and MD-11 with minimal extra training. From the outside though, it still looks and sounds exactly like the DC-10.\n\nConsidering it had been over 7 years since Calgary last saw regular DC-10 flights, and that FedEx would reportedly be retiring them around the end of last year, this was an amazing opportunity for Calgary aviation enthusiasts.\n\nThe DC-10 has been one of my personal favourite aircraft types for as long as I can remember, and so over that 4-month period, I took it upon myself to film as much of it as I could.\n\nWithout further ado, please enjoy this hour-long-compilation of FedEx MD-10s at Calgary International Airport. \n\nMore on the MD-10 Conversion: https://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_02/textonly/ps02txt.html#:~:text=The%20MD%2D10%20conversion%20achieves,pilots%20who%20fly%20either%20airplane.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

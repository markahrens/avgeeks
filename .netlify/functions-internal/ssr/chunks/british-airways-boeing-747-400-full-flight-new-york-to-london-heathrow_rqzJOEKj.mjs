In the summer this means an entirely daylight flight.\n\nOur flight begins as we board the AirTrain at New York's JFK International Airport.  We get a great view of all the aircraft at the terminals as we meander our way to JFK's British Airways Terminal 7.  We go through TSA and check out the duty free selection as we make our way to the gate where our aircraft is waiting, a 19 year old Boeing 747, first delivered to British Airways in 1999.\n\nSoon we are called for boarding and make our way onboard on this rainy morning, only to be disappointed at how scratched the window is.  Every row was exactly the same - and the most scratched windows I've ever seen!\n\nBut nevertheless we soon push back and make our way to runway 22R, where we depart into the gloomy morning, emerging a few minutes later into a beautiful sunny day above the fog.  We turn on course towards New England and climb to our cruising altitude.  We maintain ATC contact until Canada, and then shortly before the crossing we contact Gander Radio on HF Radio to obtain our Oceanic clearance.\n\nIt's a relatively smooth crossing today, and we approach the coast of Ireland on a beautiful clear evening.  We cross Ireland, the Irish Sea and Wales, before starting our descent over Bristol - all on a beautiful clear evening with great views.\n\nWe commence our approach and landing to a quiet Heathrow, touching down ahead of schedule on runway 27R and taxying to Terminal 5.  We disembark and make our way through the terminal and get the pod to the car park.\n\nAirline: British Airways\nFlight: BA178\nAircraft: Boeing 747-400 G-BYGF\nFrom: New York (JFK)\nTo: London (LHR)\nDeparture: 08:09\nArrival: 19:10\nFlight Time: 6:01\nSeat: 45A\n\n\nTIMELINE\n0:00:06 Boarding JFK AirTrain to terminal at JFK\n0:00:50 AirTrain ride to terminal\n0:11:15 Walking from AirTrain to BA Terminal 7 at JFK\n0:14:21 After TSA - Duty Free and walking to gate\n0:19:40 Our aircraft on stand\n0:19:51 Boarding aircraft and taking our seat\n0:37:33 Cabin view during boarding\n0:41:12 Cabin view\n0:49:43 Pushback and engine start\n0:54:20 Safety video\n0:57:04 ATC: Taxi clearance and commencing taxi\n1:07:07 Takeoff from runway 22R\n1:26:23 Cabin view\n1:59:42 Breakfast service\n2:14:39 Coffee service\n2:27:46 Tour of airshow map system\n2:34:29 Watching BBC News live onboard\n2:51:28 Cabin view\n3:05:15 ATC: Getting HF Oceanic Clearance for Transatlantic crossing\n5:41:30 Lunch service\n5:42:02 ATC: Contacting Shannon control as we approach Ireland\n5:48:56 Cabin view\n5:52:44 Passing a Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340-600 flying the other way\n5:55:22 Tour of inflight entertainment (IFE) system\n5:58:23 Snack service\n6:04:16 Crossing Irish coast\n6:26:21 Crossing Welsh coast overhead Pembrokeshire\n6:37:33 Severn Estuary, Bristol\n6:56:09 Commencing approach to Heathrow\n7:00:30 Final approach to runway 27R at Heathrow\n7:02:20 Landing clearance to runway 27R\n7:03:41 Exiting runway, taxi to stand 536\n7:08:10 Pulling onto stand 536, engine shutdown\n7:10:57 Disembarking aircraft, underground train to main concourse\n7:22:16 Passport control and walking to pod\n7:27:56 Pod to Business Parking",source:"youtube",source_id:"OKefktpE83g",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1537534789000)};

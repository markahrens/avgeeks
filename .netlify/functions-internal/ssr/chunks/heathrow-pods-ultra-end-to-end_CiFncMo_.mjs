Operational statistics in May 2012 demonstrate 99% reliability and an average passenger wait time over the year of 10 seconds. Ultra has achieved a number of awards from the London Transport Awards and the British Parking Awards.\n\nIt connects Heathrow Terminal 5 to its business passenger car park, just north of the airport, by a 3.9-kilometre line built on behalf of BAA, the airport's owner and operator. The system cost Â£30 million to develop.\n\nMore stuff about the ULTra technology can be found on WikiPedia.\n\nThe next flight-based trip report will be posted next week!

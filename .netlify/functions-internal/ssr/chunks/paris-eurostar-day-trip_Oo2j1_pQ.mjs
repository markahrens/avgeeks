We arrived about 11 and were departing on the 9pm train back to London, so had a full day to sightsee, and lap up the pre Christmas atmosphere. \n\nWe checked out the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Galeries Lafayette, the Arc De Triomphe, Champs-Élysées and finished with a spectacular night time view of the Eiffel tower. It was a packed day, so come along for the trip. Do let me know what you think, we had great fun filming this one, and also if you like the day trip format, considering a few more of these for 2017. Thanks guys.",source:"youtube",source_id:"FR7S4AmiY70",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1488133501000)};

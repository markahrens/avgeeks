const data = {name:"ALONE in Singapore Airlines First Class *To New York*",description:"Join me inside one of the worlds MOST exclusive First Class cabins. And what’s more, I have it all to myself today! \n\nWith just one row of First Class onboard their Boeing 777, and with tickets costing North of $8,000 this is a rare insight into how the 1% fly. As with all my trip reports, I’ll be experiencing everything from the ground service to onboard food such as Caviar and steak along with their famous Chicken Satay. We’ll get the bed made up, and as we have access to the entire cabin experience the variety of different seating options. \n\nTodays flight is unique as it’s what’s called a 5th Freedom flight. This means that we’re not flying to Singapore, but rather on their Frankfurt - New York route. This is especially useful at present, as entry into Singapore is quite the challenge. Let me know what you think down below, but this has go to be one of my favourite review flights i've taken to date. \n\nFollow my travels live here: https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel/",source:"youtube",source_id:"S9lSOuXz0gM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1642374639000)};

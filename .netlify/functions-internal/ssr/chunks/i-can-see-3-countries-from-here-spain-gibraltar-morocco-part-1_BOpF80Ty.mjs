Spain + Gibraltar + Morocco (PART 1)",description:"Like share and subscribe if you've enjoyed this video :) - http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nIt's nice to share an experience flying from a local airport such as Bournemouth as for those living further from London appreciate, it can often be frustrating to make the 2 or 3 hour commute just to fly out on holiday! \n\nI stayed for my first night at the Hilton Garden Inn near to the airport and about 20mins walk into downtown Malaga. The stay as you can see was great, and perfectly convenient for an overnighter before heading across the coastline by Marbella, Gibraltar and with wonderful views over to Morocco. \n\nThis is of course only part 1, with part 2 coming very soon which will include Seville, a luxury health spa hotel and the gorgeous Doubletree Hilton along the Costa del Sol. \n\nMy car hire guide was filmed on this trip and if you have not had the chance to check it out yet make sure you do: http://bit.ly/29Hwo6i\n\nLet me know what you think to this and my other videos in the comments below. Happy travels guys :)\n\nFor super cheap airport transfers check out Hoppa -  http://bit.ly/29HvwOY - They provided me with a great transfers from Malaga airport. \n\nGETTAXI - Download and get £5 credit for your first ride!

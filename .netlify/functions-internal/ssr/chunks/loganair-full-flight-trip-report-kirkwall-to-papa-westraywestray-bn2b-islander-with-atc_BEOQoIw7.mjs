We walk through the terminal to the inter-island departure desk, where we are soon called for boarding.  This flight is like no other - there is no security, no safety briefing, just a short walk to our tiny aircraft!\n\nWe soon get our departure clearance to Papa Westray (Papay), and start our engines for the short taxi to runway 32.  We make a powerful takeoff to the north, and start making our way across the remote Orkney islands to our first stop of Papa Westray.  We touch down on the dirt runway after a flight of just 14 minutes.  Here we are joined by some other passengers who are flying with us back to Kirkwall.  \n\nAfter a few minutes on the ground we start up and taxi for another takeoff - this time for the world's shortest scheduled flight from Papa Westray to Westray!  We taxi to the dirt runway and takeoff, almost immediately putting our flaps down to land on Westray, where we touch down on schedule after a flight time of just 80 seconds!\n\nAgain, we take on some mail and a passenger to go back to Kirkwall, before the pilot starts the engines and we are off again, crossing the beautiful Orkney islands at just 1,600ft in the sunset.\n\nWe contact Kirkwall Tower who clear us to land on runway 27, making a touchdown after a flight time of 12 minutes.  We disembark the aircraft and walk to the terminal, collecting our certificate proving that we've taken the world's shortest scheduled flight according to Guinness World Records!  We exit the terminal building to the kerb.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:05 Outside the terminal at Kirkwall, walking into the terminal\n0:01:28 Boarding our aircraft\n0:03:09 ATC: Route Clearance, startup clearance\n0:03:23 Engine start\n0:03:40 Taxi clearance to runway 32\n0:04:23 Takeoff from runway 32 at Kirkwall\n0:05:12 Cabin view\n0:07:09 Flight deck view\n0:17:48 Cabin view\n0:18:19 Final approach to Papa Westray\n0:18:59 Landing at Papa Westray (flight deck view)\n0:19:32 Taxi to terminal, engine shutdown\n0:20:41 Cabin view\n0:21:21 Passengers boarding\n0:22:15 Engine start for flight to Westray\n0:22:46 Taxi to runway\n0:24:27 Takeoff for Westray\n0:25:58 Final approach to Westray\n0:26:08 Landing at Westray\n0:27:12 Taxi to stand, engine shutdown\n00:27:12 Engine start, taxi to runway\n00:32:07 Takeoff for Kirkwall\n00:34:08 ATC: Contacting Kirkwall Radar for clearance back to Kirkwall\n00:41:58 Cleared to land on runway 27 at Kirkwall\n00:42:44 Final approach to runway 27 at Kirkwall\n00:43:06 Landing at Kirkwall\n00:45:45 Disembarking the aircraft, walking to terminal\n00:48:17 Collecting our certificate, walking through terminal to kerb\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"gBHwWRnznZU",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1513951208000)};

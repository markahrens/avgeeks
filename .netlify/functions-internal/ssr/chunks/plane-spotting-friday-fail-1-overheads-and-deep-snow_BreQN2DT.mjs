const data = {name:"Plane Spotting Friday Fail #1 - Overheads and Deep Snow ᴴᴰ",description:"Title says it all... Don't try spotting overheads with a tripod when you're surrounded by deep snow :P I would have gotten a better shot of this special livery had I been more prepared, but just saw it on final as I was walking down to get an overhead of a heavy behind it (fun fact: It's my intro!). I set up my tripod quickly, and everything was going ok.... Until I tried moving around my tripod to film the short final, when I tripped and promptly faceplanted into the snow. So, yeah. Enjoy my very first Friday Fail, based on 99carnot's series from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA).\n\nThanks for watching!

const data = {name:"Detroit to Amsterdam on a Brand-New Delta A350 - Perfectly Timed Sunrise Landing",description:"Thanks for watching this Full Flight Experience!  For our ninth anniversary, my wife Beth and I decided to use some Delta miles and head over to Europe for a three-country tour. Our trip in November 2018 is one we'll never forgot; we still talk about it every day and reminisce fondly of the beautiful places we visited, the wonderful people we met, and the time we spent together.\n\nAfter a connector flight from our home in Louisville to Detroit, we spent some time at Detroit Wayne Metropolitan Airport getting snacks and drinks for the big hop across the pond. Today, we'd fly Delta's Amsterdam service aboard their new Airbus 350, the most modern plane in their fleet. It was less than a year old!\n\nThe flight departed a little earlier than scheduled, promising an on-time arrival in Amsterdam, and a beautiful sunrise approach over the canals of the Netherlands. The timing was impeccable, and landing while the sun rises is my favorite part of any red-eye flight!\n\nThis video will take you from the pre-board to pushback, takeoff to landing and taxi at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, including a full, uncut approach across the beautiful landscape of the Netherlands! We'll check out the food offerings, as well as a bit of inflight entertainment. The A350 was quiet, comfortable, and modern, providing an enjoyable experience from wheels up to wheels down. \n\nAfter we arrive in Amsterdam, we've got one jump left, from Amsterdam to Berlin's famous Tegel Airport. I hope you're as excited as I am!\n\nThanks for flying in, and stay tuned for the upcoming legs of this journey to and from Europe!\n\nVideo Timeline\n00:00 - Intro\n01:05 - Pushback\n03:30 - Takeoff\n04:50 - Menu, Dinner, IFE\n06:15 - Breakfast\n06:50 - First Light\n08:00 - Full Approach\n13:30 - Landing\n14:05 - Welcome\n15:00 - Taxi and Planespotting\n16:45 - Gate Arrival and Shutdown\n--------------------------------\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: Delta Airlines\nFlight Number: DAL134\nDate of Flight: Tuesday, November 6th, 2018\n\nOrigin Airport: Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (KDTW/DTW)\nDestination Airport: Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (EHAM/AMS)\n\nDeparting Gate: A46\nBoarding Time: 17:40 EST\nScheduled Departure: 18:23 EST\nActual Departure from Gate: 18:09 EST\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 22L / 18:25 EST\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 18R \"Polderbaan\" / 07:18 CET\nScheduled Arrival: 08:00 CET\nActual Arrival at Gate: 07:39 CET\nArriving Gate: B43\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAircraft Information\nType: Airbus A350-941\nRegistration: N506DN \nAircraft Delivery: Dec 2017\nEngines: 2x RR Trent XWB\nSeat: 47A & 47B\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\nCanon Vixia HFM30\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView\n\nAircraft and flight information from Planespotters.net and flightaware.com\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

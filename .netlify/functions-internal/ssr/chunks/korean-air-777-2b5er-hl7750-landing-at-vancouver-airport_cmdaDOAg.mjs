const data = {name:"Korean Air 777-2B5ER [HL7750] Landing at Vancouver Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Hey everyone, here we have a Korean Air 777-200ER landing at Vancouver Airport after a long flight from Seoul Incheon. This was shot about 20 minutes after the Korean Air Cargo 747 landed, as you'll see in the video. Interesting to see 2 Korean Air planes at once at a non-Korean airport. Listen to the sound of those PW4000s reducing thrust as the 777 touches down, and then increasing when the TRs deploy, some pretty nice sound! Towards the end of the video, if you look closely, you'll see the automated gate guidance system telling the pilots how close they are to where they need to stop. Anyway, without further ado, I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching!

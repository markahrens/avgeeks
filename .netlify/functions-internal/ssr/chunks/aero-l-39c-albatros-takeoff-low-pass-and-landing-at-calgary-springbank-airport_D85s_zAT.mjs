This Czech-built L-39C Albatros is based at Calgary Springbank Airport, and is owned and flown by a former CF-18 pilot, with rides being sold to the public for $3000 apiece. This is something I've been meaning to catch for quite a while, so I'm very happy to have caught it! Enjoy this classic Czech trainer departing, doing a low pass, landing, and taxiing close up at Calgary's other airport, with ATC included!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nOperator: Jet1\nAircraft: Aero L-39C Albatros\nLivery: Czech Air Force\nEngines: 1x Ivchenko AI-25 TL\nRegistration: C-GFJT\nRoute: Calgary Springbank (YBW) - Calgary Springbank (YBW)\nCallsign: Fox Juliet Tango\nRunway used: 17\nDate filmed: May 19, 2018\nLocal time: 1200\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"F2PPSHkGkyg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1528589787000)};

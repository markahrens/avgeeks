const data = {name:"Air Transat A310-304 [C-GTSW] Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"Hey everyone, here we have an Air Transat A310 departing Calgary for Puerto Vallerta. The A310s are always nice to see, since we don't get them in the summer :)\nIn other news, I'm feeling pretty patriotic today, since Canada won the men's final hockey game in the Olympics :D (Yes I did actually wake up at 5am to watch it :P) Anyway, I hope you enjoy this baby A300, and stay tuned for something from Paine Field tomorrow :)\n\nThanks for watching!

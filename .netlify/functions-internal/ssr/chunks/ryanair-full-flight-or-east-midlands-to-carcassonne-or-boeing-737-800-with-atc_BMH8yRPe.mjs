const data = {name:"Ryanair Full Flight | East Midlands to Carcassonne | Boeing 737-800 (with ATC)",description:"A full length full flight in real time from East Midlands (EMA) to Carcassonne (CCF) onboard Ryanair Boeing 737-800 EI-FOO, operating flight FR1612 on Friday May 20 2016.\n\nOur journey begins outside East Midlands Airport's small terminal, before we enter the terminal to check in.  We then go through security and one airside get a good look around the recently refurbished terminal.  It's soon time for boarding and we head down to the gate, before walking out to our waiting 737, EI-FOO.\n\nOnce seated in seat 3F, we receive our route clearance to Carcassonne from East Midlands Tower, before pushing back and taxying out to runway 27.  We depart to the west, making a left turn and heading down towards Brighton under the watch of London Control.  Over the Channel we then contact Brest Control and eventually Bordeaux, as we are treated to great views of the coast both sides of the channel.\n\nWe commence our descent north of Toulouse, making a sharp left turn to approach Carcassonne.  We call Carcassonne Tower and are given our unique approach clearance - to follow the instrument approach for runway 10, then to break off 2 miles out and fly a visual circuit over the beautiful city of Carcasonne at low level, touching down in the opposite direction to our initial approach.  The runway is very short so we enjoy a fun landing with full reverse thrust, before backtracking and taxying to the stand.\n\nOnce parked we exit via steps, walking around the entire aircraft before entering the tiny terminal at Carcassonne, clearing immigration and collecting our bags, and then walking out to the beautiful sunshine of southern France.\n\n0:00:05  Arriving at East Midlands Airport, walking into the terminal\n0:00:59  Walking through the terminal to security\n0:01:36  After security, walking to the departure lounge\n0:02:59  Walking from the lounge to the gate\n0:03:34  Gate area\n0:04:09  Leaving the gate area, walking across to the aircraft and boarding the aircraft\n0:12:15  Receiving our route clearance from East Midlands Tower\n0:23:51  Cabin crew closing the doors\n0:26:35  Clearance to push and start from East Midlands Tower, pushing back\n0:30:51  Taxi clearance from tower, commencing taxi\n0:35:15  Lining up runway 27, takeoff to the west\n0:38:47  Contacting London Control\n0:51:42  Cabin view\n0:57:42  Crossing the south coast of England into the English Channel, overhead Brighton\n1:08:55  Crossing the north coast of France overhead Le Havre\n1:28:04  Looking around the cabin\n1:50:36  Looking around the cabin\n2:05:14  Contacting Carcassonne tower, clearance for RNAV approach runway 10, breaking off on short final\n2:08:20  Breaking off the ILS to come in from the opposite direction\n2:12:37  Cleared to land on runway 10, low turn over Carcassonne castle\n2:13:36  Touchdown on runway 10, clearance to backtrack and taxi to the terminal\n2:19:51  Disembarking the aircraft and walking to the terminal\n2:24:12  Baggage claim\n2:24:50  Walking from baggage claim through the airport, and out to the street\n\nAirline:  Ryanair \nFlight:  FR1612\nAircraft: Boeing 737-800 EI-FOO\nFrom:  East Midlands (EMA)\nTo:  Carcassonne (CCF)\nDeparture:  12:02\nArrival:  14:39\nFlight Time:  01:37\nSeat:  3F\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/4k7K6h\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

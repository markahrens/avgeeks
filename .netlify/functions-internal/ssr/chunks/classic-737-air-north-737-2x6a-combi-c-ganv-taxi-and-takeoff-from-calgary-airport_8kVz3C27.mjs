const data = {name:"Classic 737! Air North 737-2X6A Combi [C-GANV] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Air North's sole 737-200 is the last remaining 737-200 in Western Canada, with the exception of a few Nolinor ones doing charters in the Territories. Occasionally, one of their regular flights operated by the 734 or 735 may get swapped with the 732, and last Friday was one of those times! Here we have this 33 year old 737 taxiing and departing Calgary International Airport for Edmonton International Airport just after sunset, with some incredible classic engine sound. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air North (ANT/4N)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-200 Combi (B732)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17\nRegistration: C-GANV \nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Edmonton (YEG)\nCallsign: Air North 528\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: May 12, 2017\nLocal time: 2100\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/ANT517\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"lkfDig95uEg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1494819721000)};

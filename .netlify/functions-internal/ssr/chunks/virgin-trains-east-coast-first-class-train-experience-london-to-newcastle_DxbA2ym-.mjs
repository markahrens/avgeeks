This news broke after this video was filmed. It‚Äôs not clear what the next steps; this news article summarises things quite well: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/business-42945709\n\nAnyway, join me on this trip and experience the civilised enjoyment of travelling First Class on Virgin Trains East Coast. A cooked breakfast is complimentary at this time of day, and definitely more than welcome after yet another early start. For the first time in a while, I was blessed with some sunshine while travelling!\n\nSome say the East Coast Main Line is the jewel in the crown of all Britain‚Äôs intercity routes. I think that‚Äôs only partly true. For scenery, the West Coast definitely has it beat. However the East Coast was the stomping ground of the Flying Scotsman, as well as the Mallard (the world‚Äôs fastest steam locomotive, at 126mph). \n\nTravelling First Class can be affordable if you book in advance. Virgin East Coast allow bookings on most direct routes up to six months in advance. In my case, I only booked a couple of weeks out, yet I still managed to secure a ticket for reasonable value. \n\nI have lots of plans to take trains in Europe this year, as well as testing out Amtrak‚Äôs Acela Express down the American East Coast. I‚Äôll also be travelling on Eurostar to Amsterdam on the first weekend it operates, and showcasing the new luxury Caledonian Sleeper carriages and berths.

I took a trip for just €60 between Milan and Venice and WOAH, was it worth it!\n\nYou can book tickets like I did at https://www.fondazionefs.it/content/fondazionefs/en/itineraries.html?region=&train-type=Electric+multiple-unit&month= for the next trip! Keep an eye on the site, the train runs as and when and not to a schedule...plus there's plenty of other amazing heritage runs on there too with other trains!\n\nSpecial thanks to Chris Ogilvie who alerted me to the train running again, and for letting me use a small portion of his footage from his video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBrWi16jfIY\n\nThis year I'll be taking more of the world's finest and most spectacular trains. VIA Rail's four-day epic \"The Canadian\", the Hiram Bingham up to Macchu Picchu in Peru, the glorious El Chepe in Mexico, Amtrak's Southwest Chief and MORE will all come to your screens in 2022. \n\nMerch store: https://teespring.com/stores/wingin-it-3\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¦ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\n\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¦ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:41 Historical context of the Arlecchino/Settebello\n2:52 Inside the Arlecchino\n3:42 Leaving Milan at 0920\n4:54 Train facilities and onboard experience\n6:08 Belvedere observation lounge\n7:12 Express espresso\n8:44 Verona Porta Nuova - first stop\n10:13 More onboard views\n12:52 Arriving into Venice Santa Lucia, and how to book!",source:"youtube",source_id:"D-GlXzRro-g",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1662895779000)};

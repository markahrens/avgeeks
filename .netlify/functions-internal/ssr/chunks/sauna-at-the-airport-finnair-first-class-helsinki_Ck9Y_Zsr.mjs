const data = {name:"SAUNA AT THE AIRPORT?! - Finnair first class Helsinki",description:"Please like share and subscribe to TrekTrendy for more worldwide travel vlogs: http://bit.ly/1WNqym8\n\nThis was such a cool vlog to film, although I have to say it was pretty tiring, being the fact I arrived into Helsinki around midnight and then flew out again at 7am but hey! \n\nSo I'd snagged a flight on Finnair's Gdansk to Heathrow via Helsinki, and whilst I'd explored Helsinki back in my previous vlog, I wanted to opportunity to try out the non-Schengen lounge at Vantaa airport. I slept for the night (or a few hours!) at the Holiday Inn Vantaa airport, which was perfectly suitable for a stopover. The good thing about most of the airport hotels near to the airport is that Vantaa airport provides a free bus linking all of these together. Perhaps a lesson which other airports around the world could learn. After a pretty good nights sleep, I caught the bus back over to the airport. I did manage to have a quick look at the countryside around the hotel, which was beautiful. I think Finland for me is unfinished business and i'll certainly back at some stage next year. \n\nAfter going quickly through the Business class dedicated security channel, I went through passport control and entered the non-Schengen area of the airport. This to those of you not familiar is all flights departing to countries not in the visa free Schengen area within Europe. \n\nAnyway after clearing security I walked over to the Finnair Business and First class lounge, which was usefully near to my departing gate. To my surprise I was welcomed into the First Class section rather than the business I'd been anticipating, win! \n\nThe lounge is gorgeous, it may not be the largest but it was simply stunning. The lighting made it feel like a high class Mayfair cocktail club and incidentally they had an extensive cocktail menu...  not that I tried out at 6am. I explored the lounge to find a few unique surprises, such as a sleeping area, wireless charging capability and a great selection of food/drinks. But the party piece has got to be the spa which includes a Sauna, which is such a crazy yet such a Finnish thing to have at an airport. Even though it was just past 6am I just had to try it. The sauna is accessible to both business and first class passengers, as the spa is an area in between both of the lounges. You just go into one of the private changing rooms, help yourself to robes, slippers and go and enjoy a relaxing sauna. Strangely due to my extensive travel recently using lounges, i've become quite used to showering in lounges, but it still is a strange thing to get used to. Most people associate airports as busy, perhaps not that clean places. So to go and relax in a spotless and beautiful spa prior to a flight is definitely the way forward. Before catching my flight I grabbed a glass of champagne, watched a few flights from my excellent vantage point (the lounge has great views across the runway) and then walked over to my departing gate. Overall a great trip and I can't wait to try out the lounges at Helsinki Vantaa airport again soon. \n\n----- Background music -----\n\nMusic: Craig Hargrove - Keep things going higher is licensed under a Creative Commons License. https://soundcloud.com/craig-hargrove/keep-thing-going-higher",source:"youtube",source_id:"C7B_0GdB5fA",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1476637928000)};

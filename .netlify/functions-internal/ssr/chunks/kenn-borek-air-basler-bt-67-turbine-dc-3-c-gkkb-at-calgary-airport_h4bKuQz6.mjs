const data = {name:"Kenn Borek Air Basler BT-67 (Turbine DC-3) [C-GKKB] at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"One of the more interesting small aircraft at YYC! Here we have a Basler BT-67, which is a retrofitted DC-3 lengthened and re-engined, belonging to Kenn Borek Air. This video features the aircraft taxiing to their hanger at YYC and then departing again on a different day on a training flight. I'm glad KBA converted/bought some of these birds, it's like they say, the only replacement for a DC-3 is another DC-3! Anyway, enjoy my very first catch of Kenn Borek, and my first catch of one of their Basler BT-67s.\n\nSome history about this bird: It was built in 1944 for the US Air Force, which makes it now 71 years old! Easily the oldest aircraft I've ever caught on this channel. It was delivered to Kenn Borek in March 2013.\n\nThanks for watching!

A visit from KLM's gorgeous \"Orange Pride\" Boeing 777-300ER was inevitable, given their history of swapping their largest twinjet in on quite a few of their flights to Calgary in the summertime. Fortunately for me, I was in town and managed to capture it! Here we have KLM 677 and 678, arriving on runway 17L and departing 2 hours later on runway 17R. ATC is included, hope you enjoy my first ever capture, and YYC's first ever visit, of what is decidedly the best looking 77W out there!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM/KL)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-300ER (B77W)\nAircraft Name: \"Nationaal Park De Hoge Veluwe/De Hoge Veluwe National Park\" \nLivery: Orange Pride\nEngines: 2x GE90-115B\nRegistration: PH-BVA\nRoute: Amsterdam-Schiphol (AMS) - Calgary (YYC) - Amsterdam-Schiphol (AMS)\nCallsign: KLM 677/678 heavy\nRunway used: 17L, 17R\nDate filmed: August 6, 2017\nLocal time: 1300, 1500\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/PHBVA\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"pYZj_QBo5KM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1502070706000)};

const data = {name:"American Airlines MD-83 [N9622A] Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"The spot that I chose to take this video is quite unique in that the fence is fairly low, and the sound from the engines is truly amazing, even when the aircraft are just taxiing! I always love seeing AA's MD-80s here from anywhere, and, from doing some dummy bookings on AA's website, it looks like we'll be getting them for the summer too :) I hope you enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\nThanks for watching!

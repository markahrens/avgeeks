const data = {name:"American Airlines Full Flight | Philadelphia to Dublin (AA722) | Boeing 757-200 (with ATC)",description:"A full length full flight video in real time with American Airlines, from Philadelphia to Dublin, onboard Boeing 757-200 N938UW operating flight AA722 on April 4/5 2016.\n\n**Every moment of the flight included from airport to airport. ATC for full flight.**\n\nOur journey begins in the busy terminal at Philadelphia on a busy evening, as flights prepare to head off to Europe.  We board our aircraft, a 22 year old Boeing 757-200 N938UW and take our seats to commence our short overnight flight to Ireland.\n\nAfter a short taxi we get airborne and head towards New York, lighting  up the clouds below.  From New York it's on towards Canada and out across the Atlantic as we are served dinner.  \n\nThe sun starts to rise around 4h45m into the video, and we are soon treated to a beautiful dawn sky over the North Atlantic, illuminating the clouds below in a beautiful pink color.\n\nThe cabin lights soon come on and breakfast is served, as we commence our descent.  We make a beautiful approach and landing into Dublin, landing ahead of schedule after a flight time from Philadelphia of just 5h41m.  We disembark the aircraft and head through Dublin's Terminal 2, emerging streetside with minimal delay.\n\n\nKey moments in video:\n0:00:12  Walking through the A concourse at Philadelphia International Airport\n0:01:50  Boarding through gate A24\n0:19:00  Pushback and engine start\n0:23:45  Taxi to runway 9L\n0:32:00  Takeoff from 9L\n1:34:02  Dinner service\n4:48:35  Sun starts to rise\n5:04:54 Cabin lights switched on\n5:12:57  Full daylight, \n5:18:14 Breakfast Service\n5:28:00  Beautiful colors illuminating the clouds\n5:51:55 Entering Irish airspace, contacting Shannon control\n5:56:29 First Officer announces our descent and information about arrival into Dublin\n6:01:05  First views of Ireland, County Louth\n6:02:32  Crossing the coast to the Irish Sea, overhead Drogheda\n6:06:45  Making a right turn over the Irish Sea to turn back towards Dublin\n6:14:26  Howth Head peninsular\n6:14:35  Howth Harbour\n6:15:28  Baldoyle\n6:16:00  Ft Collins Park\n6:16:35  Balgriffin Cemetary\n6:17:13  M1 Motorway\n6:17:30  Dardistown Cemetary\n6:17:55  Touchdown on runway 28\n6:26:36  Pulling on stand at Terminal 2\n6:29:15  Disembarking the aircraft into the terminal\n6:31:00  Walking through Terminal 2 to immigration\n6:33:11  Baggage claim in Terminal 2\n6:35:00  Walking to the kerbside outside Terminal 2\n\nVideo taken from seat 23A.\n\nAirline:  American Airlines\nFlight:  AA722\nAircraft:  Boeing 757-200 N938UW\nFrom:  Philadelphia (PHL)\nTo:  Dublin (DUB)\nDeparture:  21:18\nArrival:  07:59+1\nFlight Time:  05:41\nSeat:  23A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/LgMWVg\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

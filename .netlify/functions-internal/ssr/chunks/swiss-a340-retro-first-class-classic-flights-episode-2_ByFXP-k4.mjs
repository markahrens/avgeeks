const data = {name:"Swiss A340 Retro First Class - Classic Flights Episode 2",description:"Let’s take a step back in time…to a time when flying first class was as much about ‘being seen’ as it was about luxury.   Welcome to Episode 2 of Classic Flights. \n\nJoin me as I step aboard the Swiss Airbus A340-300 and experience the old style retro Swiss First Class.  These seats were scheduled to be upgraded for some time but this kept being delayed so it allowed me to experience Swiss First Class in all its retro glory. \n\nSince then covid has hit the aviation industry and there are fears that First Class flying will disappear forever.  However word has it that Swiss is holding onto some of its trusty old A340's for just a little bit longer and these seats were eventually upgraded so this Swiss Classic Flights episode is a real look back in time.   \n\nThis Swiss First Class flight review was filmed on Swiss Flight LX161 from Tokyo to Zurich – it’s a long flight of over 12 hours so I get to enjoy the full Swiss First Class experience including dedicated check-in, the ANA First Class Lounge and the wonderful inflight Swiss First Class service.  This first class service includes various Swiss gourmet specialties including Balik salmon, dried meats, a boutique Swiss gin and of course plenty of Swiss chocolates. \n\nRoute:     Tokyo Narita, Japan (NRT) to Zurich, Switzerland (ZRH)\nLength:   5,968 miles,  12:29 hrs\nFlight:     LX161\nWhen:    Nov 2018\nAircraft:  Airbus A340-300  registration HB-JMH (July 2003)\nSeat:       2A\nCamera:  Sony FDR-AXP53\n\n\nThis video may not be reproduced without specific permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"CIKqs2VpVRQ",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1597827944000)};

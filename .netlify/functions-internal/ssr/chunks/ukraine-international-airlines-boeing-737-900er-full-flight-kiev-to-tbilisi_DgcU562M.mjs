const data = {name:"Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-900ER Full Flight: Kiev to Tbilisi",description:"A full length, real time full flight from Kiev Boryspil (KBP) to Tbilisi (TBS), onboard Ukraine International Airlines onboard Boeing 737-900ER UR-PSJ, operating flight PS517 on 28 May 2015.\n\n*Every minute of the flight included from boarding to arrival*\n\nThe video begins with boarding the aircraft in Kiev, and taking our seat on the less than 2 year old aircraft.  There is a delay to our departure due to the bags not yet being onboard, but once they are loaded we are away very quickly on our way.\n\nOur routing initially takes us directly south towards the Black Sea, before making a 90 degree turn directly east towards Georgia, to avoid the conflict zone of eastern Ukraine.  The sun sets over the Black Sea as we head east, and we fly in darkness for an hour before beginning our approach and landing into Tbilisi.  After landing we backtrack the entire length of the runway and take our parking stand next to a cargo 747.\n\nVideo is taken from seat 14F.\n\nAirline:  Ukraine International Airlines\nFlight:  PS517\nAircraft:  Boeing 737-900ER UR-PSJ\nFrom:  Kiev Boryspil (KBP)\nTo:  Tbilisi (TBS)\nDeparture:  20:07\nArrival:  23:38\nFlight Time:  02:31\nSeat:  14F\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/0zsB1K\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

const data = {name:"Singapore Airlines A380-841 [9V-SKS] Overhead Landing at LAX ᴴᴰ",description:"Yes, I looked at the plane. Yes, that's why this footage is so messed up. Yes, I am still kicking myself for it.\n\n*Sigh*\n\nAnyway, when I went to LAX I knew I HAD to get an overhead of an A380. You haven't lived until you've had an A380 pass 500 feet over your head ;) I love the way the runway marking reflect in the fuselage too! I hope you enjoy, nonetheless!\n\nThanks for watching!

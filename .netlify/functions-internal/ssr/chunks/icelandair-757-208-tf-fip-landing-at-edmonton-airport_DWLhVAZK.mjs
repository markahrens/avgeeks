const data = {name:"Icelandair 757-208 [TF-FIP] Landing at Edmonton Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"My first video from Edmonton in nearly 2 years! Here's a quick video from YEG, featuring TF-FIP, an Icelandair 757, landing on Runway 20. I'm glad I finally made it up there to catch this bird, and hopefully I'll be able to catch \"Hekla Aurora\" sometime as well. Just thought I'd upload this while I'm still sorting through my Tokyo footage. ATC is included as well. I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

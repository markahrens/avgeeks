const data = {name:"Canadian North 737-200 [C-GOPW] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport",description:"Back in September 2017, we received this special charter flight from a Canadian North 737-200 Combi. Canadian North has a large maintenance and charter base here in Calgary, but only with their 737-300s. The 732s permanently shifted up to Edmonton sometime in 2014, so I was glad to see one back here! Here we have 37-year-old C-GOPW making an overhead arrival on 17R and later starting up (with some incredible sound!), taxiing, and departing 17R again. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Canadian North (MPE/5T)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-200 Combi (B732)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17\nRegistration: C-GOPW\nRoute: Fort MacKay (YFI) - Calgary (YYC) - Edmonton (YEG)\nCallsign: Empress 1733\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: September 9, 2017\nLocal time: 1000\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"-UCVTZUoYgA",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1516937537000)};

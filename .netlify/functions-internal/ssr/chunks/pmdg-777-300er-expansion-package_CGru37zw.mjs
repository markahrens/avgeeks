const data = {name:"PMDG 777-300ER Expansion Package ᴴᴰ",description:"On July 18, 2014, PMDG released the Boeing 777-300ER expansion package for the PMDG 777 Base Package, which included the Boeing 777-200LR and 777F. Service Pack 1 for the 777 was also released at the same time as the -300ER, and it improves the aircraft immensely. The 777-300ER is one of the best looking aircraft out there in the real world, and PMDG has replicated it beautifully in FSX. There are over 20 new liveries made especially for the -300ER that can be downloaded via the PMDG operations center. With SP1, the PMDG 777 has become one of the best aircraft in my FSX hangar, and for anyone with the base package, the 777-300ER is a must have!\n\nThanks for watching!

We make our way to our gate, Z25, where our beautiful aircraft is waiting for us.  After a secondary security check and document check we board our aircraft and take our seat in row 53.  Before long we are welcomed onboard by our captain, Molly Flanagan, who welcomes us aboard 'this beautiful Boeing 747, which we have the privilege of flying to San Francisco today'.  We soon push back from the stand and the mighty engines power into life, before we taxi to runway 25C.  We make a heavy climb out, before making a right turn to head towards Germany's north coast.  We fly north over the North Sea, before hitting the east coast of Greenland around 3.5 hours into the flight.  We are treated to fantastic views of the mountains in the east of Greenland, before heading across the enormous Greenland Ice Sheet, which is 680 miles wide.  After we cross Greenland's west coast, we fly over Baffin Island, Canada, and get some amazing views of Canada's frozen north.  We head down across the Northwest Territories towards Yellowknife, before the ground gradually changes from ice to rock, and eventually plains as we fly over Alberta.  We get a great view of Edmonton, and Banff National Park.  From there we head into the US over Washington which is cloudy.  The cloud clears again as we pass into Oregon, giving us great views of the Beaver State.  We head towards the border with California, crossing more beautiful scenery as we head south.  We commence our descent and are soon getting a wonderful view of San Francisco.  We pass the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, downtown and the entire bay area all within a few minutes.  We then make a sweeping left turn over the mountains, taking a visual approach to runway 28R.  We approach over the bay and touch down very smoothly on runway 28R.  We then exit the runway and taxi into the terminal, disembarking through the forward doors and saying goodbye to Captain Molly Flanagan as we leave the aircraft.  We head to CBP (passport control) and then through the baggage claim and customs, emerging from the airport on a beautiful sunny evening.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:06  Walking through Frankfurt Airport to departure gate\n0:06:38  Our Boeing 747 on stand\n0:07:18  Boarding and taking our seat in 53A\n0:48:47  Captain Molly Flanagan welcomes us onboard\n0:58:00  Pushback and engine start\n1:00:04  Safety video\n1:05:40  Taxi to runway 25C\n1:11:13  Takeoff from runway 25C\n1:37:39  After takeoff water\n1:39:34  After takeoff snack\n1:44:15  Crossing Dutch coast near to Groningen\n1:52:43  Cabin overview\n2:06:14  Checking our progress on the Flight Nav app and FlightRadar24\n2:16:55  Dinner service\n2:26:55  Wine service\n2:44:32  Cabin overview\n4:35:46  Cabin overview\n4:37:14  Crossing east coast of Greenland\n5:04:57  Rear cabin overview\n5:12:42  Cabin overview\n5:30:37  Cabin overview\n6:23:11  Ice floes in Baffin Bay\n6:31:23  Crossing Canadian coast over Baffin Island\n6:43:52  Beautiful inlets on Baffin Island\n7:37:59  Drinks service\n9:04:30  East of Fort McMurray, Alberta\n9:30:00  Edmonton, Alberta\n9:51:38  Banff National Park\n10:47:47  Malheur National Forest, OR\n10:48:58  Snack service\n10:58:33  Lake Abert, OR\n11:04:28  Fremont National Forest, OR\n11:14:53  Burney Mountain, CA\n11:24:00  Close flyby: Alaska Airlines B737-800, SJC-PDX\n11:28:45  Top of descent\n11:29:35  Antelope Valley, CA\n11:30:08  ATC: Contacting Oakland Center\n11:36:02  Petaluma, CA\n11:38:32  San Pablo Bay, CA\n11:40:29  San Franciso Bay, Golden Gate Bridge\n11:41:06  San Francisco, CA\n11:43:52  San Mateo Bridge\n11:44:40  Foster City, CA\n11:52:38  Turning onto final approach to runway 28R\n11:55:15  Landing on runway 28R, taxi to gate\n12:06:20  Disembarking through forward doors, walking through terminal\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"kzp6rDmP4Hw",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1498222796000)};

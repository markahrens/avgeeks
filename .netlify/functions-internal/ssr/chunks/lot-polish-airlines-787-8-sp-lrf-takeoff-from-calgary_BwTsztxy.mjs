const data = {name:"LOT Polish Airlines 787-8 [SP-LRF] Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"Who would have thought that Calgary's first foreign 787s would be from LOT? They've been operating RAF charters for the past few weeks, and I believe this is their 6th flight into YYC, the other 5 came while I was still on vacation. I'm glad that I was able to catch at least one of them, even though this isn't my best video. Hopefully they come back a few more times...\n\nThanks for watching!

The aircraft is de iced on this chilly morning, before we push back and depart to the north.  We contact Athens Departure who vector us towards the Adriatic coast.  We then contact Athens Control who clear us to climb to our cruising altitude today of 34,000ft.  We pass up the coast of Greece and into the Adriatic getting a stunning view of the Greek mountains before we are handed over to Brindisi control as we enter Italian airspace.\n\nWe then fly the length of Italy on this beautiful morning, before crossing the snowy Alps as we descend towards Geneva.

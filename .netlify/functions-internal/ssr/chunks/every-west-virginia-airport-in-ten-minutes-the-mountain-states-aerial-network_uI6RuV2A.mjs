const data = {name:"Every West Virginia Airport in Ten Minutes - The Mountain State's Aerial Network",description:"Thanks for joining me on this Miles By Tour tour of all seven commercial airports in West Virginia!\n\nWest Virginia's small population and size might normally preclude it from commercial air service, but the mountainous terrain and the many moderate-sized cities throughout the state require air travel to effectively connect these cities with the outside world. As beautiful as West Virginia is, sometimes you need to get in and out fast! \n\nEach airport, even the largest, is modest in comparison to other American cities, so we can cover all of them in one video! All of these airports have interesting origins, histories, and roles they play in the state's infrastructure, making all of them worth a visit, however briefly!\n\nThe information contained within this video was accurate and up-to-date as of June 2021, when I visited these airports. The progress of the COVID-19 pandemic may change the routes, schedules, and frequencies I mentioned.\n\nFinally, let me know where you'd like to see next! Now that I've been vaccinated, I'm able to travel with more confidence. Stay tuned for new flight and airport videos every two weeks!\n\nThe contents of this video and its production are not endorsed by any entity portrayed therein, and none of the entities provided any input or compensation in the production of this video.\n\nIf you'd like to speak with me directly about the contents of this video or my channel, you can reach me at milesbyfoot at gmail.com.\n\nThumbnail by my artist wife, Beth!\n\nIG: bethmclain.art\nTwitter: Marshmallowbat\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:45 - Airport #1 - Huntington (HTS)\n01:35 - Airport #2 - Beckley (BKW)\n02:32 - Airport #3 - Lewisburg (LWB)\n03:42 - Airport #4 - Charleston (CRW)\n05:55 - Airport #5 - Parkersburg (PKB)\n06:36 - Airport #6 - Clarksburg (CKB)\n07:38 - Airport #7 - Morgantown (MGW)\n08:30 - Conclusion\n\nThanks again for watching, and keep moving forward!\n\n#airport #airporttour #westvirginia #wv #contourairlines #charlestonwv #aviation #travel #huntington #beckley #lewisburg #parkersburg #clarksburg #morgantownwv #wvu \n\n_______________________________________\n\nEquipment Used\nGoPro Hero 7 Black\nFeiyuTech G6 Gimbal\nClip Studio Paint\nAdobe Premiere Pro\nIrfanView\nAudacity\n\nMusic\nMarigold - Bonsaye\nJakarta - Bonsaye\nHuaraz - Bonsaye\n\nSources\ntristateairport.com\nflybeckley.com\nmylwb.com\nyeagerairport.com\nflymov.com\nflyckb.com\nmorgantownairport.com\n\nflightaware.com\nallegiantair.com\naa.com\nunited.com\ndelta.com\nspirit.com\ncontourairlines.com\niflysouthern.com\nwikipedia.com",source:"youtube",source_id:"n78ZjjEngss",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1638725403000)};

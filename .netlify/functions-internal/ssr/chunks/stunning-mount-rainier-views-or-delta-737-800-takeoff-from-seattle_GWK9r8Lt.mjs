const data = {name:"STUNNING MOUNT RAINIER VIEWS | Delta 737-800 Takeoff from Seattle",description:"A gorgeous fall takeoff from Seattle on board this Delta Boeing 737-800, with some great CFM56 engine sound from the spool up on runway 34C to the thrust reduction. Plus, an incredible view of Mount Rainier on the climb out towards Salt Lake City on Delta Air Lines Flight 1297! This was previously part of a trip report I did on this flight, but the views and the engine sounds were too good to not give them their own upload. Views of Mount Rainier start at 7:35.

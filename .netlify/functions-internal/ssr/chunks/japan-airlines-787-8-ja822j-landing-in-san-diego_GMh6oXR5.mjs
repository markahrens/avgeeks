const data = {name:"Japan Airlines 787-8 [JA822J] Landing in San Diego ᴴᴰ",description:"Hey everybody, here's a new San Diego video for you all, and this one features one of San Diego's best heavies, the Japan Airlines 787! If the filming seems slightly shaky in some spots, it's because a bee decided to land on my tripod just after the plane came into view. I managed to catch a fairly good shot of this Dreamliner, and avoided getting stung too :) Hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

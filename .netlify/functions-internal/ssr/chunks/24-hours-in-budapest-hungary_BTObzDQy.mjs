In these few hours I picked up my camera and take you along for a trip around the Old Town, riverside on the River Danube, Buda Castle, Buda Terrace and some spectacular views out over the Parliament building. I'd have loved more time, and I will definitely be back in the future to film more. What a lovely city! Hope you enjoy the video guys and see you again, very soon\n\nMusic by \nJoakim Karud http://youtube.com/joakimkarud\nFuture James - Life Could Be A Dream https://soundcloud.com/jamesasilo",source:"youtube",source_id:"0U6l93N-v3Y",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1543425852000)};

We visit the VIP Guacimeta Lounge (one of the most basic lounges I've ever been in!) prior to departure.\n\nAnother solid Club Europe flight, but you have to wonder what BA were thinking of with a starter of poached pears, stilton cheese and dill sauce - unnecessarily daft, complex, and not acceptable for something so niche to be the only choice! Why not just have a salad?\n\nEnjoy the video.\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTRAINS, ANYONE? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iSjr-5LbaA \n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek \n\nMusic courtesy of Czech Vibes Sound\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",source:"youtube",source_id:"iPR8LpHjAkk",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1497771301000)};

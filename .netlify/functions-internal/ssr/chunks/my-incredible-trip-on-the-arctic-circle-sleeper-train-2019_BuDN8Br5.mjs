A true bucket-list journey, this is nowhere near as expensive as you'd think, and the only barriers you have in taking this trip are managing to brave the cold.\n\nMy tip: for snow, head there in April like I did. It's a little above freezing and the thaw is beginning, but it's still truly Arctic - watch the people on quad bikes and snowmobiles in my video! In summer, the snow mostly disappears, leaving behind a rich green landscape. It's still a wonderful, beautiful place, but I rather prefer the snow myself! Don't go in midwinter if you can help it - there's not much daylight at that latitude!\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit.

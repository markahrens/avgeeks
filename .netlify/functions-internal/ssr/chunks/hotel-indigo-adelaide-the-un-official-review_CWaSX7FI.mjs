const data = {name:"Hotel Indigo Adelaide - The Un-Official Review",description:"The Hotel Indigo Adelaide Markets opened its doors on 1 March 2021 making it one of Adelaide’s newest hotels. \n\nI was lucky enough to spend the night at the Hotel Indigo Adelaide Markets recently and brought my camera along.  So here is the Un-Official Hotel Review of the Adelaide Hotel Indigo.  \n\nThis hotel review includes all the hotel facilities including the bar, Market & Meander Restaurant, Merrymaker rooftop bar, the swimming pool and gym and of course, the room. \n\nThe Indigo brand is part of the IHG hotel group and no two Hotel Indigo’s are the same anywhere in the world.  Each Hotel Indigo is designed and created based on the city it is located in – therefore to stay at a Hotel Indigo is to be immediately immersed into the culture of the city you are visiting.  How did they do in Adelaide?  Watch the review to find out. \n\nOnce you’ve watched this video don’t forget to check out my channel for more travel fun including lots of flight reviews on the world’s best and worst airlines. \n\nHappy travels!\n\nDennis\n\n#HotelIndigoAdelaide #HotelReview #Adelaide",source:"youtube",source_id:"oBBg7Ylu30M",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1632740099000)};

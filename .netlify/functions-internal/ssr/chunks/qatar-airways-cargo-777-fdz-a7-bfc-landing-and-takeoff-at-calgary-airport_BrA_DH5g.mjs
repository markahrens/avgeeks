const data = {name:"Qatar Airways Cargo 777-FDZ [A7-BFC] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Every summer, several equestrian events are held in Spruce Meadows, a venue south of Calgary famous for its show jumping horse events. Show jumping horses are brought in from all around the world for these events, and this particular flight was bringing some of the horses from the \"North American\" tournament back to Europe. I wasn't able to catch it last year, so I'm glad to have caught both the arrival and departure of this special annual visitor this time! ATC is included, hope you enjoy. \n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Qatar Airways Cargo (QTR/QR)\nAircraft: Boeing 777 Freighter (B77F)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE90-110B1L\nRegistration: A7-BFC\nRoute: Mexico City (MEX) - Calgary (YYC) - Liege (LGG)\nCallsign: Qatari 8168 heavy\nRunway used: 35L, 35R\nDate filmed: July 10, 2017\nLocal time: 1030, 1430\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/A7BFC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"0PmLnfO5OIM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1499741554000)};

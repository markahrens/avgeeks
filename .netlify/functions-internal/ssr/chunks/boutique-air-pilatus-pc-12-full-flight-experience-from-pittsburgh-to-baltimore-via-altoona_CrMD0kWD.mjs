const data = {name:"Boutique Air - Pilatus PC-12 - Full Flight Experience from Pittsburgh to Baltimore via Altoona",description:"Welcome to this Full Flight Experience aboard a Boutique Air Pilatus PC-12 from Pittsburgh International Airport to Baltimore/Washington Thurgood Marshall International Airport via Altoona!\n\nBoutique Air is a young airline flying primarily single-propeller Pilatus PC-12s along several groups of disconnected routes around the U.S. under the Essential Air Service. Their destinations and routes are constantly changing and shifting, but they have several core routes on the East Coast, in the Southern states, and in the Southwest. I love the personal, small-scale experience when flying EAS airlines, and I love to see how smaller communities connect to large airports, so I knew I had to give Boutique Air a try!\n\nWe're taking an early-morning flight on one of their core routes: Pittsburgh to Baltimore. The route currently stops in Altoona in Blair County, about halfway between the two major airports. While this route is also served by Southwest Airlines, Boutique offers easy connectivity to United and American flights once landing in Baltimore.\n\nThis flight takes us over the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, across valleys and farmland that dots the southern parts of the Keystone State, offering an enjoyable and unique experience, with excellent customer service and an on-time arrival. \n\nThanks for flying with me, and enjoy the ride!\n\nVideo Timeline\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:30 – Walk to Plane\n01:25 – Boarding and First Officer’s Safety Presentation\n02:20 – Pushback\n03:30 – Takeoff from Pittsburgh\n06:00 – Initial Descent into Altoona\n06:45 – Short Final into Altoona and Landing\n08:10 – Interior at Altoona and Boarding\n10:00 – Takeoff from Altoona\n11:30 - Initial Descent into Baltimore\n12:00 – Short Final into Baltimore and Landing\n\n#flight #flightreport #flightreview #boutique #pilatus #pittsburgh #pit #baltimore #bwi #altoona #altoonapa \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFlight Information\n\nAirline: Boutique Air\n\nFlight Number: 4B 841\n\nDate of Flight: Sunday, June 27th, 2021\n\nOrigin Airport: Pittsburgh International Airport (KPIT/PIT)\n\nIntermediate Airport: Altoona–Blair County Airport (KAOO/AOO)\n\nDestination Airport: Baltimore/Washington Thurgood Marshall International Airport (KBWI/BWI)\n\nDeparting Gate: A16\n\nBoarding Time: 07:17 EDT\n\nScheduled Departure: 07:15 EDT\n\nActual Departure from Gate: 07:29 EDT\n\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 28R / 07:29 EDT\n\nIntermediate Runway: RWY 21 / 08:03 EDT / 08:25 EDT\n\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 33R / 09:09 EDT\n\nScheduled Arrival: 09:25 EDT\n\nActual Arrival at Gate: 09:13 EDT\n\nArriving Gate: D36\n\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n\nAircraft Information\n\nType: Pilatus PC-12/47\n\nRegistration: N95GE\n\nAircraft Built: December 2006\n\nEngines: 1 x PT6A-67P (Pratt & Whitney)\n\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n\nGear\n\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\n\nGoPro Hero 7 Black and Suction Mount\n\nFeiyuTech G6 Gimbal\n\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView/ClipStudio\n\n\n\nAircraft and flight information from planespotters.net and flightaware.com.\n\nArt and Icons by Beth McLain\nIG: bethmclain.art\n\nMap graphics and information from OpenStreetMap.com. © OpenStreetMap contributors\n\n\n\nThis video is not endorsed by, nor affiliated in any way with Boutique Air, Inc.

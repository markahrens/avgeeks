Only using my link!\nhttps://www.piavpn.com/Trektrendy\n\nJoin me today on the Queen Mary 2 luxury ocean liner, as we travel from London to New York across the Atlantic. We're retracing the historic route, many would have taken between Europe and the USA. I'll share with you exactly what it's like to live onboard this ship for the 7 day voyage, from my Princess Grill Suite, to the various restaurants, the spa facilities and even the kennels! The best part is i'm taking my mum along for the trip, something i've been desperate to do forever! \n\nI hope you enjoy my first venture in the world of cruises (although don't let anyone hear you call this a cruise, it's a voyage!). I will continue to review First Class flights & sleeper trains, I just thought this was an interesting change up for the channel.   \n\n0:00 - Intro\n3:51 - Suite tour\n6:00 - Restaurants \n9:19 - Outside deck\n13:51 - Afternoon Tea\n16:22 - Gala Dinner \n21:22 - Stormy Atlantic \n22:53 - New York City",source:"youtube",source_id:"pTeiw9vYGzg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1670785218000)};

They haven't updated the cabin to the newer slimline seats, and although those are fine, you can't go wrong with 3 inches of padding. Here we have C-FFWN, a now 27 year old A320 departing Montréal Pierre Elliot Trudeau International Airport for Calgary International Airport back in September. C-FFWN was operating AC1145, one of many direct flights between YUL and YYC, and is seen here pushing back, taxiing, and departing runway 24R with a fantastic view of the terminal and then climbing away over the Québec countryside.

Thanks to Honey for sponsoring!\n\nMy most ambitious flying adventure yet! What is it like to fly for 24 hours across the world to Japan.. and back, in Japanese First & Business Class? Well today I’m going to find out, in the brand new All Nippon Airways (ANA) 777 First Class Suite on my outbound, and the ANA 787 Boeing Dreamliner in Business Class coming home. \n\nAs usual in my trip reports, I'll be walking through in detail, what it's like to fly these luxury products; the food, bed and overall experience. What better way to try it, in 24 hours back to back! Just to explain, this is one of my most ambitious trips of 2021, something I really wanted to share in its entirety. If you want an even more in depth review of ANA's First Class or indeed their New Business Class named The Room, go check out my dedicated review. \n\nFollow my travels live on IG: https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel\n\nGo check out my buddy FlightHacks: https://www.youtube.com/c/FlightHacks",source:"youtube",source_id:"H5NMmOpsylE",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1640561951000)};

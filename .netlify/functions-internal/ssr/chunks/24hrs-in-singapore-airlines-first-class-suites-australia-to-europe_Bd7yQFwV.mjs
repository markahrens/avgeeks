This ticket is eye wateringly expensive, and is the most i’ve ever spent on a flight. As always I’ll be bringing you along every step of the way from the exclusive Private Room lounge at Singapore International Airport, to a tour of both suites on the Boeing 777 and Airbus A380. This is easily the largest private space you get in the sky with a separate bed and armchair. I’ll share with you the incredible food on offer from Caviar to Lobster to traditional Singaporean cuisine. \n\n0:00 - Introduction\n1:32 - Sydney Lounge\n2:33- 777 First Class\n6:58 - Lunch time\n9:43 - The bed\n12:32 - The Private Room\n14:19 - A380 Suites\n16:51 - Dinner \n19:08 - Bedroom",source:"youtube",source_id:"pqrzOQtE4oo",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1663539239000)};

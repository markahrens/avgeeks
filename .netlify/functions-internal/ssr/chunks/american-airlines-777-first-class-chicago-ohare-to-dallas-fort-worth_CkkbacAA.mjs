This particular rotation uses a Boeing 777-200.\n\nThe 777-200s are in the process of being converted from having an International First Class cabin to having the new business class product. However, there are still a few knocking about with the old style First seats. \n\nThis cabin was definitely in need of ripping out, but you can't beat a huge armchair, personal TV and personal office on a two-hour flight! Enjoy the video - a bit of a trip back in time...\n\nSubscribe and comment guys!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"pc-V2ChUQS4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1474351259000)};

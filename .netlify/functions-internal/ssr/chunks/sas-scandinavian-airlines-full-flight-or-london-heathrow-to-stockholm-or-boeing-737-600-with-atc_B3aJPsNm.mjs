We enter the terminal and head for the security checkpoint.  Once airside we make our way to the Lufthansa Business Lounge.  We take a walk around the lounge and grab breakfast before it is time to catch our flight.\n\nWe make our way to the gate where our aircraft is waiting to take us to Sweden.  We board through the forward doors and take our seat in SAS Plus, in seat 2F.  Once onboard we are welcomed onboard as the rest of the passengers board.  We push back from the gate on schedule and are cleared to taxi to runway 27L.  We are cleared to take off and make a beautiful departure our of Heathrow, making a right turn soon after takeoff and heading towards Clacton, in Essex.  We climb to our cruising altitude of 41,000ft (FL410) as we head across the North Sea.  We're served our SAS Plus breakfast box as we cross the sea.\n\nWe make landfall over the coast of Denmark, crossing the north of Denmark before we cross the sea to Gothenburg, Sweden.  We then fly across beautiful Sweden, eventually starting our descent near to Orebro, Sweden.  We make a beautiful approach towards Stockholm, making our approach to runway 19L.  We make a butter smooth touchdown, before taxying into the terminal.  We disembark through the forward doors into the terminal, and make our way through the terminal to emerge kerbside.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:05  Walking into Heathrow Airport Terminal 2, through check in hall\n0:01:39  After security, walking through departure lounge\n0:04:55  Lufthansa Business & Senator Lounge walk through\n0:07:17  Breakfast in the Lufthansa lounge\n0:07:29  Leaving the Lufthansa lounge and walking to the gate\n0:09:47  Our aircraft on stand\n0:10:11  Boarding our aircraft through the airbridge, taking our seat in 2F\n0:15:32  Cabin overview\n0:21:42  Welcomed announcement from the flight deck\n0:26:19  ATC: Push and start clearance, push and start commence\n0:31:02  Taxi clearance, taxi to runway 27L\n0:36:08  Line up and wait runway 27L\n0:38:24  Take off clearance, take off\n0:40:59  Slough, UK\n0:44:27  Watford, UK\n0:48:40  Cabin view\n0:51:14  Essex, UK\n0:54:20  Ipswich, UK\n0:56:32  Southwold, Suffolk coast, UK\n1:01:39  Breakfast service\n1:02:27  Breakfast service\n1:25:41  Cabin view\n1:44:05  Danish Coast, Thorsminde, Denmark\n1:54:53  Aalborg, Denmark\n1:59:08  Læsø Island, Denmark\n2:04:52  Gothenburg, Sweden\n2:31:55  Cabin view\n2:32:11  Lake Malar/Mälaren, Sweden\n2:39:12  Skofjärden, Sweden\n2:42:20  Final approach for runway 19L\n2:44:53  Landing runway 19L, taxi to terminal\n2:53:34  Disembark through forward doors into terminal\n2:58:00  Passport control\n3:03:36  Exiting terminal to taxi ramp\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"Q-j1t8xP1Go",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1500641998000)};

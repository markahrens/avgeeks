const data = {name:"\"Private Plane\" Experience with Boutique Air!",description:"Join me on a really unique trip report! \n\nBoutique Air is an aviation company based in San Francisco, California. The airline offers charter services as well as scheduled passenger services subsidized under the Essential Air Service (EAS) program.\n\nThe company was founded in 2007 by Shawn Simpson, an early employee of Google. It was originally an aviation technology company before it began acquiring a fleet of aircraft in 2012 through its holding company Targaryen LLC. It operated on-demand charters, pilot training, and air patrol services for government sectors using Cessnas before purchasing Pilatus PC-12 aircraft to operate its passenger charter flights.\n\nThis flight takes place on one of those PC-12 aircraft. With just eight seats configured in a business jet layout, this is as close as you can get to a private jet experience. The cost? A little over Â£100. \n\nA really surreal experience, walking out onto the LAX tarmac between the international wide body aircraft, to our tiny PC-12. Free water and sodas were available on the aircraft. \n\nThere are no proper interior or exterior video clips available until the aircraft arrives at an intermediate stop - Merced Municipal Airport. This is because the aircraft was hidden from view from LAX T3, and the walk to it was done across an active apron, escorted by a despatcher. \n\nBoutique Air operate a number of eclectic routes across the Western USA. Maybe check them out...?\n\nAs always, please share, like and leave a comment! And definitely SUBSCRIBE! :-)\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"KGw-61MWGrc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1473336826000)};

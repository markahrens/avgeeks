const data = {name:"FIRST VISIT! Canadian North Boeing 737-700 at Calgary Airport",description:"Earlier this year, Canadian North took delivery of two Next Generation Boeing 737-700s that were formerly flown by WestJet. C-FHBO and C-FHNI were flown to Edmonton in February, where they sat for several months in storage.\n\nOn August 10th, C-FHBO flew its very first flight under Canadian North's callsign, on (presumably) a training flight between Edmonton and Calgary.\n\nGreat to see this ex-WestJet bird finally flying again, and especially with Canadian North! Wonder what the cabin looks like...\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video!

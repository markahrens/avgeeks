const data = {name:"Loud and Smoky! Cargojet 727-223AF [C-FCJV] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Occasionally, Cargojet sends their classic 727s (which are the last ones remaining in Canada) to YYC early in the morning on Saturdays. Normally, they arrive while it's still dark and leave just before sunrise, but last Saturday's visit was a nice exception. Here we have C-FCJV, a 36-year-old 727 arriving on 35L, taxiing for departure (with a curious ground controller), and making a quick takeoff on 35R, all with some great engine sound. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Cargojet (CJT/W8)\nAircraft: Boeing 727-200F (B722)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 3x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-15\nRegistration: C-FCJV\nRoute: YHM-YYC-YVR\nCallsign: Cargojet 579\nRunway used: 35L, 35R\nDate filmed: May 6, 2016\nLocal time: 0600, 0710\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFCJV\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"qRPxomq-A_U",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1494288949000)};

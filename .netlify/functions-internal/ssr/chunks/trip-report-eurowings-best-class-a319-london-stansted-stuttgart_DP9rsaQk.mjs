A first time with Eurowings, with a great value BEST fare. This is basically business class in all but name, including fast track security, lounge access, a blocked middle seat and anything you want from the menu onboard. Super value at less than £90 one-way and a real competitor to full service airlines.\n\nI definitely recommend giving Eurowings BEST a try if you're a current customer of full service airlines - this fare rivalled even many basic economy fares for this given date.\n\nI hope you like the video - don't forget to leave a comment - I do read them all!\n\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek #eurowings #a319\n\nMusic courtesy of Czech Vibes Sound\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",source:"youtube",source_id:"BzpQfunXOhk",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1494757147000)};

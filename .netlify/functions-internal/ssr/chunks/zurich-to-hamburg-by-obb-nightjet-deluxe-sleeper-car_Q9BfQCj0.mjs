So here’s a great train trip!\n\nThis OBB Nightjet train runs daily from Zurich to Hamburg-Altona, leaving at 20:00, and arriving shortly after 09:00 the following morning. It’s one of only two OBB trains which use the double decker “schlafwagen” carriages (sleeper cars). \n\nI’ve travelled on a few sleeper trains before and they’re all pretty similar in terms of layout. This is different, with the deluxe sleeper I occupy taking up the roof space on the top deck of this train. It also features a small seating area, and a fully functioning shower, as well as ensuite toilet. Each carriage has a dedicated attendant who will check your ticket, greet you, wake you, and serve you breakfast.\n\nOverall, this is a niche and interesting way to travel. While sleeping-car travel is on the decline in Europe, thanks to shoestring budgets and the arrival of budget airlines and safer/higher quality hostels, this train holds its own. \n\nIf you do this trip, here’s some expectation management from me:\n- There’s no restaurant on board (there are only a couple of hot microwave meals available) – eat beforehand in Zurich. There are plenty of places to suit all budgets both in the station, and within a couple of minutes walk.\n- This is not “luxury first class” – it’s pragmatic and the premium charged is for the space. Remember, it’s run on a tight budget, so you’ll occasionally notice a bit of wear and tear.\n- Beds will cause a problem if you’re over six feet tall (I’m 5’9” so no issue for me…)\n- The top deck is where the deluxe cabins are, like mine. This is great for viewing but you’ll also feel the swaying of the train more. That might bother you, but it didn’t bother me.\n\nAnd some big positives to encourage you:\n- Sleeper trains remain a very efficient way to travel. And they’re fun, too, I promise.\n- Tickets are very easy to buy at https://tickets.oebb.at/en/ticket (that’s the English language page).\n- All staff speak good English; no German or French phrasebook necessary.\n- The beds are very comfortable with a decent mattress and duvet included.\n- You get to see the countryside.\n- Deluxe cabins have fabulous double windows and roof-lights. It feels, and is, spacious – for a train.\n- It’s different, isn’t it?\n\nLong live the sleeper train.\n\nCALEDONIAN SLEEPER TRAIN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKQgkqdIhDc  \n\nGRAND CENTRAL FIRST CLASS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iSjr-5LbaA \n\n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #trains #nightjet #OBB #sleepertrain #gopro #iphone #deluxe\n\nMusic: Joakim Karud – Almost Original\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",source:"youtube",source_id:"go42NiAqtJk",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1492933882000)};

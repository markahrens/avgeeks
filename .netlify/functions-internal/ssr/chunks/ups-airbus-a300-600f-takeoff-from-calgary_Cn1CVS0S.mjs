const data = {name:"UPS Airbus A300-600F Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"Hey everyone, this is a United Parcel Service Airbus A300-600F departing Calgary International Airport, bound for Sioux Falls. Normally UPS flies a 767-300F on this route, but sometimes they'll switch to the A300, which is always nice to see.

const data = {name:"British Airways 787-8 Dreamliner [G-ZBJG] Dusk Landing at Calgary Airport",description:"The 787 never gets old! Here we have British Airways' seventh 787-8 Dreamliner approaching and touching down on runway 35R at Calgary International Airport in some beautiful dusk light. This is an old video from late 2014, and the 787 will be returning to replace the 767 on December 5, 2015. Sorry for all the wind noise. This clip is from October 2014, before I got my external microphone and wind cover. I hope you enjoy, nonetheless!\n\nSorry if I haven't been responding to comments.

const data = {name:"Visiting Every Hoosier Airport in a Day! - Three Complete Tours of Indiana's Regional Airports",description:"Thanks for joining me on this Miles By Tour tour of Indiana's three commercial airports!\n\nIndiana's spread-out nature means that traveling to the Hoosier State's main airport in Indianapolis can be inconvenient and time-consuming. Today's tours will also show that, in many cases, it's unnecessary; there's a great airport right around the corner from you! We'll cover the three airports at Evansville, Fort Wayne and South Bend in detail, from the traffic they see, to the terminal layouts, to planespotting!\n\nThe information contained within this video was accurate and up-to-date as of March 2022, when I visited these airports. As the country reopens more routes and adjusts schedules, all of the flight details contained within this video may change, so double check with your airline or the airports' websites, just in case!\n\nThis is the first video of a three-month playlist, set to conclude in September 2022. Please subscribe and turn on notifications to follow allow each step of my journey as we explore some of America's greatest airports together!\n\nThe contents of this video and its production are not endorsed by any entity portrayed therein, and none of the entities provided any input or compensation in the production of this video.\n\nIf you'd like to speak with me directly about the contents of this video or my channel, you can reach me at milesbyfoot at gmail.com.\n\nThumbnail by my artist wife, Beth!\n\nIG: bethmclain.art\nTwitter: Marshmallowbat\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:40 - Airport #1 - Evansville (EVV)\n03:25 - Airport #2 - Fort Wayne (FWA)\n05:55 - Airport #3 - South Bend (SBN)\n09:25 - Conclusion\n10:20 - End Screen\n\nThanks again for watching, and keep moving forward!\n\n#evansville #fortwayne #southbend #airport #aviation\n\n_______________________________________\n\nEquipment Used\nGoPro Hero 7 Black\nFeiyuTech G6 Gimbal\nClip Studio Paint\nAdobe Premiere Pro\nIrfanView\nAudacity\n\nMusic\nSalty Tales - Dye O\nVista - Dye O\n\nSources\nflightaware.com\nallegiantair.com\naa.com\nunited.com\ndelta.com\nwikipedia.com",source:"youtube",source_id:"bBMt3lvZWRI",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1655571627000)};

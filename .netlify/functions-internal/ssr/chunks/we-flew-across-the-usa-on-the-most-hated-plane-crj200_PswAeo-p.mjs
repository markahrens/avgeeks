const data = {name:"We Flew ACROSS The USA on the MOST HATED PLANE (CRJ200)",description:"Watch this video to see what it's like to fly across the USA on the most hated plane, the CRJ-200!\n\nIn this video, we’ll travel from our home in Greensboro, NC all the way to California, but only using regional jets! We’ll mostly focus on the CRJ 200, but the close cousin, the ERJ-145 will make a brief appearance, too.\n\nThese regional jets are easy to hate, but we wanted to put them to the ultimate test by crossing the entire country in them. The CRJ-200 is particularly uncomfortable and a lot of airlines are getting rid of them, but United Airlines, through the United Express brand, has more 50 seat regional planes than American and Delta combined, so we’ll be on a lot of United CRJ200 airplanes in this video as we fly across the USA on the most hated plane!\n\nWhy do passengers think the CRJ 200 is the worst plane?\n\nFor starters, they don’t have plugs or Wi-fi, the Windows are too low, the overhead bins can’t accommodate roll aboard bags, there’s barely any headroom, the lavatories are tiny, there’s no first class or even economy plus, the seats are incredibly small, and if the plane isn’t full, people in the front may have to move to the back to ensure proper weight and balance. In short, CRJ200’s and ERJ145’s are pretty easy to hate. \n\nBut what do you think?

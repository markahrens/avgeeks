The journey will take around 13 hours covering close to 500 miles - it will give me the chance to show you all the features of this new sleeper train. There are two levels of service offered, Second Class sleepers and First Class sleeper cabins. Only First cabins have access to showers of which I'll try out and let you know my thoughts. \n\nThis train has quite a famed dining car... but you'll find out why food today is well, quite non existent. I'll also break down the cost for this adventure - which may surprise you given the cost of similar overnight trains in Europe or indeed Amtrak in the USA. \n\nAs always with my trip reports and reviews, do let me know what you think - is this a rail journey you'd like to take? \n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:00 - Chiang Mai Station\n3:30 - 2nd Class\n4:43 - 1st Class\n6:45- Bedtime\n9:00 - The Shower\n10:48- The Top Bunk\n11:41 - Bangkok Station",source:"youtube",source_id:"XGpsx5Y67p0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1652047085000)};

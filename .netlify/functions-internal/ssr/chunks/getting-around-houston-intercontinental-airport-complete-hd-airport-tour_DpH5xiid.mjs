const data = {name:"Getting Around Houston Intercontinental Airport - Complete HD Airport Tour",description:"Thanks for joining me on this airport tour of Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport! Today's tour covers one of the busiest airports in the United States and the third largest hub for Star Alliance member United Airlines! \n\nBuilt as a replacement for Houston's Hobby Airport, IAH now serves nearly 200 destinations across the globe, historically offering service to all six inhabited continents. As a hub for United Airlines, Houston has a number of United Clubs and lots of space dedicated to their flights, including a large regional hub, making connections easy and stress-free.\n\nI do a lot of original research while preparing these videos, so please leave a comment below if you have questions about the tour or navigating the airport, and I'll do my best to answer them!

Newcastle and Southampton are, in my opinion, the two best regional airports in the UK, with excellent transport connections, good route options and great passenger facilities. \n\nFlybe have always struck me as a somewhat unremarkable airline (though they do have an impressive route network). Their workhorse is the Dash 8 Q400, which is my least favourite aircraft. Why? Partly irrationality, but I really don‚Äôt like Bombardier aircraft. CRJs happen to be my least favourite jet aircraft and the Dash 8s always seem flimsy and frankly a bit ugly. \n\nThe weather in Newcastle was superb - a shame the same couldn‚Äôt be said for Southampton! Next international flights I have are a real mix. It‚Äôll be a very busy long weekend at the end of the month, as I travel using Edelweiss, Helvetic, Blue Air, and Swiss using five different aircraft types (and I‚Äôm really looking forward to trying my first CS100...hoping it breaks my dislike of Bombardier products!). \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

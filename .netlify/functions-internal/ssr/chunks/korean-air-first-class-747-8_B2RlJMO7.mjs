I won't travel without it!\n\nWhat could be more romantic than a flight on a Boeing 747?! Well, I recently flew Korean Air First Class in a Korean Air 747! The flight was from Seoul (ICN) to Atlanta (ATL) and is Korean Air’s longest flight. \n\nThis Korean Air First Class 747 experience was exceptional. \n\nThe Korean Air 747 will be one of the final Queens of the Sky to fly because Korean Air is one of only a few airlines to have ordered the 747-8. Take a look at what it's like in one of the final passenger 747's to roll off of the assembly line. This Korean Air 747 experience met their brand's promise of \"Excellence in Flight!\"\n\nWatch this video to see what made the trip in the Korean Air 747 so special. And there was a lot! Not only was sitting in Korean Air First Class Seat 1A in front of the pilots amazing, but the Korean Air First Class cabin crew kept the food and champagne flowing! I’ve never eaten so much on a flight before! Along the way, this flight report will include information about the seats, the inflight entertainment, the food, and the cabin crew from this Korean Air Boeing 747-8 flight! \n\nI’ll even rate Korean Air First Class using my “JebScore:”\nhttps://GreenerGrass.com/JebScore\n\nBy the way, nobody is more “bummed” I accidentally deleted the take-off and landing footage from this Korean Air First Class flight than I am! Guess I’ll just have to give it another try…\n\nWhat do you think of Korean Air First Class?

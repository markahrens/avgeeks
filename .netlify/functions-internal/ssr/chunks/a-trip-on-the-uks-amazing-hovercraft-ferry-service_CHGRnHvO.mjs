British company Hovertravel is the last passenger ferry operator in Europe, and the only operator of a year-round scheduled hovercraft anywhere in the world. \n\nI'd never been on a hovercraft before, and it was about time I ticked it off! It was good to get to the Isle of Wight; I had a few holidays there as a little kid (and even remember standing by the hovercraft landing stage and watching it arrive and leave!). We'd always taken the traditional car ferry across the Solent. \n\nAll the fare details are here: https://www.hovertravel.co.uk/standard-fares/ - and don't forget you can get through rail tickets to the island right down to Shanklin that include the hovercraft if you wish!\n\nSpitbank Fort: https://solentforts.com/spitbank-fort/\n\nThis video was filmed in September 2020, during relaxed public travel restrictions in England.\n\nA safe, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all; I hope you enjoy this little Christmas bonus video!\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¦ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\n\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¦ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me",source:"youtube",source_id:"-8fQciHXmoQ",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1608976846000)};

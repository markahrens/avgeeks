Here's my trip on the epic Intercity Notte sleeper train from Milan down to Palermo on the island of Sicily. This is a must-complete trip for any serious rail enthusiast - from the awesome Milano Centrale station to the splendid tunnels at Genoa, to the beaches of the Tyrrhenian coast and the unique shunting operation at Villa san Giovanni onto the ferry for the short ride to Messina, this is a train trip that has just about everything (except a DINING CAR!).

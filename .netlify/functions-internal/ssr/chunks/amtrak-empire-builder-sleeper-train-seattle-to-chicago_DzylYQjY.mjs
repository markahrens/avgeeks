const data = {name:"Amtrak EMPIRE BUILDER Sleeper Train (Seattle to Chicago)",description:"Watch this video in order to experience the Amtrak Empire Builder train as it crosses some of the most dramatic land in the United States, passing through Washington State, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois\n\nThanks to a delay, we saw more than most passengers would expect, including some of the most stunning scenery we’ve ever encountered in Northern Idaho.\n\nThe entire Amtrak Empire Builder route is scheduled to take 46 hours, but our trip ended up taking a lot longer. We were supposed to leave Seattle at 4:55 in the afternoon, but didn’t get going until nearly 8:00 at night.\n\nThe Amtrak Empire Builder is certainly one of Amtrak’s most iconic routes, passing through the very heart of Glacier National Park. My first experience onboard an Amtrak overnight sleeper train was this route, but Westbound back in 2020. It felt incredible to be back onboard!\n\nIn this video, you’ll see the unmatched scenery and spectacular sights along the route, get a tour of Amtrak’s Bedroom, learn the history of this route, and we’ll even answer some of the most frequently asked questions we get asked about Amtrak Train Travel.\n\nWe’ll also showcase Amtrak’s Traditional Dining, which has (finally) returned to their long-haul western routes like the Empire Builder!\n\nThe Amtrak Empire Builder route traces its heritage back to 1929 when it was the flagship route of the vaunted “Great Northern Railway.” In the early part of the 20th century, railroad companies were the airlines of their time. Perhaps none were as storied as the Great Northern Railway.\n\nThe Amtrak Empire Builder is the latest incarnation of a route The Great Northern Railway operated. This is the northernmost transcontinental railway in the country and was also the only privately funded transcontinental railroad in the nation’s history. Unlike every other one, it was built without any federal funding. \n\nToday, Amtrak is the only passenger operator the Empire Builder route and, as with nearly all of Amtrak’s operations, we competed with freight traffic, which always takes priority  because the freight lines own the track on this route. Amtrak is just borrowing it for the Empire Builder, which means delays are very possible. But, it turns out, our delay was the best thing that could have happened on this journey…\n\nWatch this video to see one of the most luxurious experiences available on the rails in the United States: Amtrak’s Empire Builder in an Amtrak Bedroom!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:04 Boarding the Amtrak Empire Builder\n3:28 Wake Up Day Two\n7:14 Getting Ready on Amtrak\n11:44 Amtrak Bedroom Tour\n16:28 Amtrak Dinner\n19:37 Amtrak FAQ's\n28:44 Bloopers\n\nCheck out Miles in Transit here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@MilesinTransit\n\nAnd here’s a link to Simply Railway:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SimplyRailway\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nHere are my other Train Videos:\nhttp://Jeb.Flights/Trains\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMUSIC:\nI Will Be Gone (Instrumental Version) - Vicki Vox\nFirst Glimpse of You - Victor Lundberg\nA Sweet Dream - Victor Lundberg\nA Dance in the Sun - Erik Fernholm\nThe Sun Will Shine (Instrumental Version) - The Eastern Plain\nFree Mind - Wildflowers\nSummer Love (Instrumental Version) - Kylie Dailey\nCalming Rain - Candelion\nSwaying - Candelion\nI Wish (Instrumental Version) - Mindme\nIf I Wrote You a Song (Instrumental Version) - Melanie Bell\nSongs for a Mockingbird (Instrumental Version) - Gabriel Kelley\nThis Poor Love Song (Instrumental Version) - Sture Zetterberg\nOn and On (Instrumental Version) - Lars Eriksson",source:"youtube",source_id:"teN-Y1wAu78",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1678550425000)};

const data = {name:"KLM A330-303 [PH-AKE] Crosswind Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"I must say, the A330-300 with CF-6 engines is one nice looking bird! Much more proportional than its little brother the A330-200.  Here we have \"Praça de Rossio - Lisboa\" arriving at YYC, fighting some winds just before touchdown. The airport was on crosswind ops previously but then they switched back to the parallels just before this bird arrived, which sent spotters scrambling all over the place :P I'm certainly not going to win any awards for camera work with this shot, but regardless, I hope you enjoy this close up video of KLM's 5th A330-300 landing at Calgary Airport on Runway 17L :)\n\nThanks for watching!

You turn it into the coolest and funkiest hotel around!\n\nBuilt in 1962, the TWA Flight Center was in use as an airport terminal until 2001....in 2019 it reopened as the TWA Hotel JFK and it is without doubt the coolest hotel I've stayed in.  Yes there are fancier hotels but none capture the golden era and glamour of 1962 aviation like this place. \n\nNO this is not a paid advert - I paid for my room in full and the hotel didn't know I was coming.  They don't even know I did a review.  \n\nEnjoy your stay!",source:"youtube",source_id:"n2tvYz42jxY",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1576151240000)};

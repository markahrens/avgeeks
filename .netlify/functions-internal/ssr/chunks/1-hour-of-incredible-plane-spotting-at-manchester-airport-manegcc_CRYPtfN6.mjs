const data = {name:"1 HOUR of INCREDIBLE Plane Spotting at Manchester Airport! (MAN/EGCC)",description:"In February 2020, I flew to Manchester, UK, in order to cross off a flight on the Air Transat A310, but also to do some plane spotting in the north of England! Manchester Airport has some amazing variety, with so many airlines that I'd never seen before (and sadly, never would again). These videos were all shot over two days, and are arranged in chronological order of the time of day they were filmed.\n\nThis video wouldn't have been possible without two good friends of mine, @JonathanWinton123 and @Mraviationguy, who both made the journey to Manchester to meet up with me. I had a fantastic few days of spotting with them, and it was a wonderful trip to the UK. I really do appreciate their coming out, go check out their channels!\n\nJonathan Winton: https://www.youtube.com/user/flyhellas101\nMraviationguy: https://www.youtube.com/user/Mraviationguy\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

const data = {name:"WestJet Link Saab 340B Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport",description:"At the end of June, WestJet launched a feeder service operated by Pacific Coastal Airlines of British Columbia known as WestJet Link. WestJet Link connects their Calgary hub to 5 smaller cities in the area - Lethbridge (AB), Medicine Hat (AB), Lloydminster (AB), Cranbrook (BC), and Prince George (BC), operated by 34-seat Saab 340 aircraft. These Saabs are now the smallest aircraft to wear WestJet's livery, but were painted prior to WestJet's unveiling of their updated branding, so for the time being, they wear the slightly modified 2015 livery. Here we have C-GPCJ, one of several Saab 340s in WestJet paint, pushing back, taxiing, and taking off runway 17R for Medicine Hat.

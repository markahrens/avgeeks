const data = {name:"INCREDIBLE: Finnair's brand new, UNIQUE business class",description:"Finnair's new AirLounge seat has just debuted! I got a tip off an upgraded A330 was flying the London - Helsinki route and so naturally I just had to check it out. I was very unsure as to whether I would like this new seat, which doesn't recline, has only one mechanical part and represents a big risk on the part of Finnair....so....I went to try it. And loved it. These seats are coming to all their long haul wide body fleet, both A330 and A350.

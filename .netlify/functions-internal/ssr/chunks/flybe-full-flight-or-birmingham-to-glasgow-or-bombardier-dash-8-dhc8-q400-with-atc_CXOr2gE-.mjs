We enter the terminal, go through security and head to the Flybe gate area to wait for our flight.  Unfortunately our flight is delayed by around an hour, thanks to a delay earlier in the day.  We are eventually called for boarding and make our way to the boarding gate, before walking out to our awaiting aircraft, DHC8-Q400 G-ECOG.  \n\nWe board and take our seats in row 7, before the captain comes into the cabin to personally apologise for the delay, which is revealed as being due to a passenger earlier in the day who decided not to fly and required the entire flight to be deboarded and processed through security again!\n\nWe finally get our pushback clearance and taxi to runway 33 at Birmingham, making a spritely takeoff towards the northeast and making a direct track for Glasgow.  We climb to our cruising altitude of 24,000ft, heading for Manchester and Carlisle before commencing our descent into Glasgow.\n\nIt's a beautiful afternoon in Glasgow as we commence our approach, and touch down an hour late on runway 23 at Glasgow.  We head to stand 20 and then disembark through the forward steps, before heading through the airport to the kerb where we are able to grab a taxi into Glasgow.\n\n0:00:04  Outside Birmingham Airport, walking into terminal\n0:03:13  Security control\n0:03:55  After security, walking to Flybe gates\n0:11:48  Flybe gate area\n0:12:54  Boarding the aircraft\n0:19:20  Cabin during boarding\n0:25:38  Captain comes into cabin to personally apologise for the delay to our flight\n0:27:06  Push and start clearance\n0:32:27  Taxi to runway 33\n0:38:41  Take off clearance and takeoff from runway 33\n0:59:16  Cabin overview\n1:24:32  Commencing approach to Glasgow, vectors from ATC for approach and landing on runway 23\n1:27:06  ILS for runway 23\n1:30:30  Touchdown on runway 23, taxi to stand\n1:35:25  Disembarking the aircraft and walking through to the taxi ramp outside\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"W_90FzpoEc0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1495198802000)};

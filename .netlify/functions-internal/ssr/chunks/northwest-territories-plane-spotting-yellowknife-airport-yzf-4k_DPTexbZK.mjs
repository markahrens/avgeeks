const data = {name:"NORTHWEST TERRITORIES PLANE SPOTTING! Yellowknife Airport YZF (4K)",description:"At the end of last month, I paid a visit to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories in order to get one last flight in on Canadian North's Boeing 737-200 before it was retired.\n\nWhile I was there, I spent a couple hours at Yellowknife Airport - the busiest in Northern Canada - and filmed some of the regular action. The diversity of aircraft is unmatched anywhere else in the country, from a 70+ year old Curtiss C-46 Commando to several rare Dash 7s! Enjoy!\n\nA big thank you to Air Tindi for those close up shots later in the video :)\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

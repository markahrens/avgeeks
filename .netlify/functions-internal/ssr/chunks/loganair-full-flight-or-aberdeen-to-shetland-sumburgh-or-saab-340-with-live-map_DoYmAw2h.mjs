We enter the terminal building and walk to security, and walk through the departure lounge to our gate where the pilots are conducting the preflight walkaround of the aircraft.  We are soon called for boarding and make our way out across the ramp to the aircraft, boarding our Loganair aircraft which still wears the livery from the Flybe days.  Inside however the aircraft is all tartan, and we take our seat at the rear in seat 11A.  \n\nIt starts raining while we wait to push back, but soon we are on our way taxying out to runway 34 at Aberdeen.  We make a very bumpy takeoff to the northeast, soon entering clear weather as we make our way north towards Fraserburgh and Peterhead.  We are served complimentary snacks - coffee and a Tunnocks Wafer.  The weather clears nicely as we cross the coast giving us a great view of the sea and oil rigs in this part of the world.  We fly past Fair Isle before commencing our descent into a rainy and windy Sumburgh, on the southern tip of the Shetland Islands.  These are the most northerly part of the UK, and the weather is typically Scottish being very grey and rainy!  We make a bumpy approach over the sea landing firmly at Sumburgh before making our way to the terminal.  We disembark to horizontal rain and walk into the much warmer terminal, heading out to the kerbside outside the airport.\n\n0:00:06 Outside Aberdeen Airport, walking into terminal\n0:01:18 Walking to security\n0:01:42 After security, walking to departure lounge\n0:02:33 Walking to gate\n0:05:35 Pilot doing pre flight check of aircraft\n0:06:31 Boarding the aircraft and taking our seat in 11A\n0:10:39 Cabin view\n0:16:26 Doors closed\n0:18:50 Safety demonstration, engine start\n0:21:15 Pushback\n0:25:20 Taxi to runway 34\n0:29:45 Line up runway 34\n0:34:03 Cabin view\n0:35:27 Rear cabin view\n0:42:59 Crossing Scottish coast at Peterhead/Fraserburgh\n0:45:16 Inflight snack: Tunnocks wafer and coffee\n0:51:20 Cabin view\n0:52:33 \"Captain Alpha\" Oil Rig Platform\n0:59:38 Cabin view\n1:08:54 Fair Isle, commencing descent to Sumburgh\n1:12:42 Turning final approach for runway 09 at Sumburgh\n1:18:05 Landing at Sumburgh\n1:21:20 Pulling on stand at Sumburgh\n1:24:11 Disembarking, walking into terminal\n1:26:23 Walking out of terminal to kerb\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"VREC7LOO7RI",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1506182948000)};

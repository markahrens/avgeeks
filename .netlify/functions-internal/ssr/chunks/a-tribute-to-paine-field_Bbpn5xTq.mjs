It's such an awesome airport, with so many 787s it's unbelievable. Whenever I go back though, it's gonna be even better, since the 787-9 is now up and flying, and it visits Paine fairly often, along with more 787s for more airlines. Anyway, here's what you all voted for last video, with a unanimous vote for this video. I hope you enjoy it! :)\n\nThanks for watching!

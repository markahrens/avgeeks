An A300! :) I thought I would make this FSX video, since I don't have any A300 footage at the moment :/ This is also my first FSX video with REX 4, a texture pack for FSX that greatly enhances the textures of pretty much everything in the sim. Hope you enjoy, and stay tuned for a 747 tomorrow ;)\n\nThanks for watching!

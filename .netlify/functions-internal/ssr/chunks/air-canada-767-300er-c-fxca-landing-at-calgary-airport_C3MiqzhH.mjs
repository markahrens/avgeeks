After a long absence of YYC videos, here we have an Air Canada 767-300ER arriving from Tokyo on Calgary's Runway 35L. Let me know if you'd like to see some more videos from this spot, let me know, since it is fairly good, with the exception of the touchdown zone being blocked (Although that can be fixed by standing in another location. Hope you enjoy, and stay tuned for some San Diego action for tomorrow! :) I also have a new upload schedule up on my channel page, take a look if you want!\n\nThanks for watching!

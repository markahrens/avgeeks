Once expired that's it - he loses it for ever. \n\nOur only option - to race to Perth, Western Australia before another of their infamous snap border shutdowns sealed our fate. \n\nJoin as as we fly from Adelaide to Perth - a return trip of over 5,500km - to renew Jamie's passport.  Along the way I'll review  both Qantas and Jetstar, we take a close look at Perth, enjoy a lunch at the beach and talk to a local to see if they really want borders to stay closed forever.",source:"youtube",source_id:"6n-fGjyigoQ",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1635238115000)};

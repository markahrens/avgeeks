Before long we push back and head for runway 18L, before taking off into the sunrise.  Our route initially takes us up towards Ardmore, TX before making a left turn on course for Denver.  Thanks to the bumpy ride at most altitudes we level out at only 28,000ft for our short trip north.\n\nOur journey is mostly over desert this morning, and before long we commence our descent into Denver.   We descend on a beautiful clear morning getting a great view as we are vectored towards the ILS for runway 17R.  We make a smooth approach and touchdown ahead of schedule, before taxying in to the terminal.\n\nTIMELINE:\n\n0:13:15  Pushback from stand\n0:17:30  Taxi to runway 17L\n0:24:55  Line up and take off runway 17L\n2:04:32  Downwind for Denver Airport, vectors for ILS runway 16L\n2:09:39  Final approach for runway 16L\n2:11:21  Touchdown runway 16L, taxi to terminal\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"Yv2kbBwEYpE",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1492779593000)};

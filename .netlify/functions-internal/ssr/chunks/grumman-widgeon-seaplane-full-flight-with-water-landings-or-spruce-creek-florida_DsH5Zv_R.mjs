const data = {name:"Grumman Widgeon Seaplane Full Flight with Water Landings | Spruce Creek, Florida",description:"A full length, full flight video onboard Grumman G44 Widgeon N88638, operated by Chester Lawson from Spruce Creek Fly-In Community, Daytona, FL.  This is the full flight with engine start, take-off, some water landing/takeoffs (including some by myself!), and the flight back to Spruce Creek.  Spruce Creek is a fly-in community, where planes share the roads with cars and trucks, and you taxi right up to the garage at the house, an amazing experience in itself!\n\nThe flight begins with starting our engines and taxying out through the fly in community to the runway, before taking off and heading to Lake Ashby, a remote lake to the south of Daytona in Volusia County.  After a few landings and takeoffs, I am given the controls and get to fly my first multi engined aircraft!  I do a couple of takeoffs and landings, and then we head back to Spruce Creek where we make a smooth landing among the houses, taxying in through the community back to the house, parking the aircraft right in the garage!\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"KoZVhxhavrg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1401640921000)};

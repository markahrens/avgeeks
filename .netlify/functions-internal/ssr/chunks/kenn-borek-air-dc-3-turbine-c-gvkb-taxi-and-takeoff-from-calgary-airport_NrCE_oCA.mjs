const data = {name:"Kenn Borek Air DC-3 Turbine [C-GVKB] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Kenn Borek Air is a Calgary-based airline which operates a number of unique charter flights all over the globe, notably, to Antarctica during the southern summer. They operate several DC-3 Turbines, or Basler BT-67s, along with a large fleet of De Havilland Twin Otters. The Basler BT-67 is a converted Douglas DC-3 that's been lengthened and re-engined with Pratt and Whitney turboprops. As they say, the only replacement for a DC-3 is another DC-3! Here we have C-GVKB taxiing up close on Yankee and departing runway 35L at Calgary International Airport for a training flight to Red Deer Regional. ATC is included, enjoy!\n\nSome history: It was built in 1944 for the US Air Force, now 73 years old and one of the oldest aircraft I've ever filmed, right alongside sistership C-GKKB and B-17G N5017N! It was delivered to Kenn Borek in 2009.\n\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Kenn Borek Air (KBA/4K)\nAircraft: Douglas DC-3 Turbine (DC3T)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Basic white\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-67R\nRegistration: C-GVKB\nRoute: YYC-YQF\nCallsign: Borek 169 Trainer\nRunway used: 35L \nDate filmed: March 29, 2017\nLocal time: 0945\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2017\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"qiQShJ6YmOQ",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1490926637000)};

Here we have a 36-year old Gulfstream G-III landing on 17L about a week ago, arriving from Oxford, Connecticut. Sadly no ATC for this one, but I hope you enjoy this short clip anyway!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Private\nAircraft: Gulfstream G-1159A (G3)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Private\nEngines: 2x Rolls-Royce Spey MK-511SR\nRegistration: N540EA\nRoute: Oxford (OXC) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: November 540 Echo Alpha\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: May 5, 2017\nLocal time: 1930\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"QKfAMb6g3_U",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1494707447000)};

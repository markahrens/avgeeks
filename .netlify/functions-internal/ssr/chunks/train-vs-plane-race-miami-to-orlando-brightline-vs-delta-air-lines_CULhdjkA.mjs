const data = {name:"TRAIN vs PLANE Race Miami to Orlando (Brightline vs Delta Air Lines)",description:"Watch this video to find out whether a train can beat a plane? \n\nBrightline just opened the newest intercity train in the United States in Florida between Orlando and Miami. With speeds up to 125 miles per hour, there’s a chance that taking the train is faster than flying. And, in this video, we’ll put that to the test.\n\nWe’ll also consider other factors, too. Not only will we test the time, but we’ll also compare the overall comfort, the ability to actually get work done, the onboard service, and the price. Using these factors, we think you’ll be able to figure out which mode of transportation you’d prefer!\n\nBut, ultimately, can the speed of an airline overcome the comfort and pace of high-speed rail? \n\nJoin us in this video as we pit Brightline against an Airplane in order to determine which mode of transportation is faster. \n\n0:00 Introduction \n2:44 Brightline Lounge in Orlando\n3:29 Brightline Train\n10:08 Delta Flight\n15:19 Comparison\n17:22 Bloopers\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMUSIC: \nImpact Point - Hampus Naeselius\nDon’t You Think I Know They’re Faster - Eden Avery\nTo the Core - Dream Cave\nGanga - Aks & Lakshmi\nGone Without A Trace 1 - Fredrik Ekstrom\nEasy Relief - Gold In June\nHigh Tech - Rocket Jr\nPerfect Colours - Tomas Skyldeberg\nRaging Fires - Edgar Hopp\nEasy Relief - Gold in June\nCranked - Jon Sumner",source:"youtube",source_id:"3hMSe_t_XcI",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1697900406000)};

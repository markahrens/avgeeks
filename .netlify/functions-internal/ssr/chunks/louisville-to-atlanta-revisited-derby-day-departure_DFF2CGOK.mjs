const data = {name:"Louisville to Atlanta Revisited: Derby Day Departure",description:"Thanks for watching this Full Flight Experience!  \n\nIn May 2017 I had the opportunity to take a research trip to the Highlands of Scotland and experience some of my favorite locales in the world!  There were plenty of opportunities for walking, exploring, and recording my discoveries, and the fun started even before I departed.\n\nThis six-part journey started at SDF, my home airport, on a particularly busy day: Derby Day. Louisville is home to the Kentucky Derby, one of the world's best known and most watched sporting events. Here in Louisville, we have several weeks of celebration and events leading up to race day, and while the airport is packed with racegoers and tourists coming to our fair city, not many are on their way out.\n\nThis first leg is one I've flown many times before, and even once on this channel! Still, the experience is always an exciting one, if for no other reason than the adventure that starts just an hour and twenty minutes away.\n\nThanks for flying in, and stay tuned for the upcoming legs of this journey to and from the British Isles!\n\n--------------------------------\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: Delta Airlines\nFlight Number: DAL2171\nDate of Flight: Saturday, May 6th, 2017\n\nOrigin Airport: Louisville International Airport (KSDF/SDF)\nDestination Airport: Atlanta Hartsfield/Jackson International Airport (KATL/ATL)\n\nDeparting Gate: A5\nBoarding Time: 06:56 EDT\nScheduled Departure: 07:20 EDT\nActual Departure from Gate: 07:19 EDT\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 17L / 07:34 EDT\n\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 26R / 08:36 EDT\nScheduled Arrival: 08:52 EST\nActual Arrival at Gate: 08:42 EST\nArriving Gate: F9\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAircraft Information\nType: Boeing 737-700\nRegistration: N307DQ \nAircraft Delivery: January 2009\nEngines: 2x CFM56-7\nSeat: 18A\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\nCanon Vixia HFM30\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView\n\nAircraft and flight information from Planespotters.net.\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

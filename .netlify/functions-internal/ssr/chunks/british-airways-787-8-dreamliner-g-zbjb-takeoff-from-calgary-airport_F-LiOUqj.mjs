const data = {name:"British Airways 787-8 Dreamliner [G-ZBJB] Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Seeing BA taking off in daylight during the winter months here at YYC is a pretty rare event. On January 8th, 2015, BA103 from LHR to YYC had an engine failure in-flight and returned to Heathrow. The following day, BA sent two 787s to Calgary, one being the regular flight, and the other carrying the passengers from the cancelled flight. The replacement 787 then took off the following day (January 10th) at 1513 local time, as seen in this video. Sorry about the shaky filming and the building in the way of the climb out. This wasn't my ideal location but it's better than nothing. Enjoy the video and the sound of those RR Trent 1000 engines!\n\nThanks for watching!

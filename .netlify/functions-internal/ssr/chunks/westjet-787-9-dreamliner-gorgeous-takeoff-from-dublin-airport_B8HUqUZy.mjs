const data = {name:"WestJet 787-9 Dreamliner GORGEOUS Takeoff from Dublin Airport!",description:"On my return trip from Dublin to Calgary, I flew with WestJet again, but in the back of the Business Cabin on board their 787!\n\nI'll be uploading a proper trip report on this flight in the future, but in the meantime, I wanted to share what I think is one of my best takeoff videos yet. Everything worked out wonderfully on this departure, with some perfect head-on lighting, gorgeous scenery, and engine sound! That engine and wing view combination from row 4 on the Dreamliner is unbelievable.\n\nI have a lot more content in the works, but for now, enjoy this gorgeous afternoon departure from the Emerald Isle!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner\nFlight Number: WS005\nSeat: 4K (Business Class)\nLivery: New (2018)\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B\nRegistration: C-GUDO\nRoute: Dublin (DUB) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WESTJET 5 heavy\nRunway used: 28\nDate filmed: June 2019\nLocal time: 1500\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",source:"youtube",source_id:"qGyIXC1Orsg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1565046975000)};

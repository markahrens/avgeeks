WestJet 767-338ER [N328BC] ATC, Taxi, and Parking at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Follow me on Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\nThe second of WestJet's four 767s purchased from Qantas! Here we have former VH-OGN, a trusty 767-300ER that served Qantas for just over 20 years delivered to her new Canadian owner. After those 20 years of service down under, it was retired and ferried to Victorville, California in September of 2014. Some time later, it was ferried once again to Chennault, Louisiana, where it would be refitted with a new cabin and winglets, and receive a fresh coat of paint. This video includes the Air Traffic Control communications from the tower and ground controller (with captions), the aircraft taxiing in, and a time lapse of the aircraft being towed into its parking position, with a visit from a family member at the end :) Enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

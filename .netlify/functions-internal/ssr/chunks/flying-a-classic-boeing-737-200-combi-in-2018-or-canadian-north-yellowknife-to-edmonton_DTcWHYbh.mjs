const data = {name:"FLYING A CLASSIC BOEING 737-200 COMBI IN 2018 | Canadian North Yellowknife to Edmonton",description:"Canadian North is an airline that operates within Canada's Northwest Territories and Nunavut, with a fleet of Dash 8 and Boeing 737 aircraft - which happens to include two Boeing 737-200 Combis equipped with gravel kits for use on unprepared runways in the North. The 737-200s fly primarily up north, but they do operate a few flights from Alberta's capital, Edmonton, to Yellowknife, the largest city and capital of the Northwest Territories. I made a day trip in June from Edmonton (a 3 hour drive from Calgary) to fly this unique aircraft and visit a part of Canada I've never been to before. This trip report consists of the second half of the journey, a gorgeous sunset flight from Yellowknife Airport back south to Edmonton International Airport on C-GOPW, a 38-year-old 737-200 Combi.

const data = {name:"Air North 737-2X6A Combi [C-GANV] Landing and Taxi at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"This classic 737 was a treat to see! Here we have Air North's only 737-200, a combi, arriving on runway 17R and then taxiing into gate 12, arriving from Dawson Creek (YDQ) and later departing for Cranbrook (YXC) (that video will come later). The 737-200 is a rare bird in YYC these days, and I'm very happy to have filmed this one in particular! Sorry about the wind noise, it was 20 gusting 30 knots that day and I was on the top level of a seven-story parkade. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air North (ANT/4N)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-200 Combi (B732)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-17\nRegistration: C-GANV \nRoute: YXY-YDQ-YYC-YXC-YVR\nCallsign: Air North 517\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: March 18, 2017\nLocal time: 1400\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/ANT517\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"xDXYT14mc04",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1489950071000)};

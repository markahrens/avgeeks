Thomas Cook are a very old and reputable travel agency in Britain, famous for their vintage ‚Äúdon‚Äôt just book it - Thomas Cook it‚Äù slogan from years ago. \n\nAnyway, when I came to book this flight I was able to select Economy Plus for an extra ¬£50 on top of the basic fare. This seemed like good value, so I paid it and looked forward to checking it out. \n\nIn Plus, you get:\n\n- Dedicated seating at the front (but no blocked middle seat, this isn‚Äôt a business class)\n- Complimentary James Martin meal\n- Free drinks from the bar runs (but I assume *not* on demand, constantly)\n- Enhanced hold and cabin baggage weight allowance\n- Priority boarding\n- Faster security where available \n- Priority baggage handling \n\nSeems alright for fifty quid. \n\nWell, I was very impressed. I‚Äôve always had a conception of charter and holiday airlines to have low standards. Maybe this is because they‚Äôre catering to infrequent fliers who are on holiday anyway, and are already in a good mood and who don‚Äôt have many experiences to compare it to. \n\nWhat I loved:\n- Very professional, not cheesy, feel to the product throughout \n- Premium meal was very tasty and would pass for a business class meal, presented differently \n- All staff were pleasant and smiling. Good vibes\n- Short delay outside their control handled well\n- They have Magners cider \n- Aircraft was old but spotlessly clean\n- Bag arrived very promptly at Birmingham \n- Seats were slimline but comfortable with good legroom\n\nCouple of downsides:\n- Meal didn‚Äôt look great upon opening (though was very nice!)\n- Window scratches!\n\nOverall, a very good experience. I‚Äôd definitely recommend Economy Plus if you can stretch the budget that little bit further. \n\nMy next trip report is going to be VERY special indeed, especially if you‚Äôre a fan of my train reports....\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

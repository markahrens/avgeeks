Before long we get an iPhone notification that our flight is ready for boarding, and we walk through to the gate where our aircraft is waiting, Airbus A320 G-EUUU.  It's not long before boarding is announced and we make our way down the airbridge onto the modern A320.\n\nAfter taking our seat in seat 2F we are given a safety demonstration and cleared to push back from the stand.  Fortunately it's an unusually quiet day at Heathrow today and the taxi to runway 27L takes just a few minutes before we are cleared to take off.  We make a powerful buzzsaw departure into a beautiful evening, getting a fantastic view of the entire airport and surrounding area from above as we turn right after departure.\n\nCruising altitude today is a pretty low 18,000ft, for the short flight over the Midlands towards Manchester.  For most of the flight we are only just above the cloud giving an illusion of high speed.\n\nWe commence our descent to Manchester overhead Leicester, and make a left turn towards Buxton descending over the Peak District.  Once again there are no delays and we head straight for the ILS for runway 23R.  We descend on the ILS and are filmed landing by fellow YouTuber World Aviation HD.  We then taxi to the gate, and disembark into the terminal walking straight through to the road outside the terminal.\n\nTimeline:\n\n0:00:03  Going through the transfer channel at Heathrow Terminal 5, document check\n0:01:10  Walking through departure lounge in Terminal 5A\n0:02:28  Boarding called via BA iPhone app, walking to gate A5\n0:04:50  Boarding announced and boarding the aircraft, taking our seat in 2F\n0:22:30  Welcome announcement from the flight deck\n0:26:50  Push and start clearance from ATC\n0:31:20  Taxi clearance to runway 27L\n0:44:08  Lining up runway 27L, cleared for takeoff\n0:54:28  Meal service/Buy on Board\n1:09:00  Commencing descent  towards Manchester\n1:13:43  ILS approach to runway 23R\n1:16:09  Landing on runway 23R, filmed from onboard and ground\n1:22:06  Disembarking through airbridge into terminal, walking to street\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"h8Sylv-P09o",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1486735207000)};

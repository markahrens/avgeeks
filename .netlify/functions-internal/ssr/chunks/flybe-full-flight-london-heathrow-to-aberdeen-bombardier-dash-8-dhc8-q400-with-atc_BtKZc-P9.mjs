We enter the terminal and head through security, before making our way to our gate.  We watch our aircraft land on runway 27L, before making our way to a bus to board our ride which is on a remote stand.\n\nAfter a bus journey across Heathrow we board via steps, taking our seat in row 6.  We soon get our clearance and pushback before taxying to runway 27R for takeoff - our tiny aircraft overshadowed by the giants of Heathrow!  We depart to the west, making a right turn and making our way towards the Midlands on a beautiful clear morning.  We fly over Nottingham, Mansfield and Sherwood Forest, before heading towards South Yorkshire.  The great views continue as we make our way further north, coasting out over the North Sea near to Newcastle.  We then remain over the sea before commencing a straight in approach to runway 34 at Aberdeen, making an arrival on schedule just over 80 minutes after takeoff.\n\nWe disembark and make our way into the terminal to wait for our connecting flight.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:08 Outside Heathrow Terminal 2, walking into terminal\n0:02:04 After security, walking through departure lounge\n0:05:34 Our aircraft lands from Aberdeen\n0:06:15 Walking to gate\n0:07:38 Boarding bus to gate, bus ride to aircraft on remote stand\n0:23:44 Boarding aircraft, taking seat in 6D\n0:27:26 Cabin view\n0:34:04 Captain welcomes us onboard\n0:35:32 Cabin view\n0:44:42 Pushback, engine start\n0:49:28 Taxi to runway 27R\n0:58:24 ATC: Clearance to line up and wait\n0:58:44 Line up runway 27R\n0:59:23 Takeoff runway 27R\n1:02:16 Slough, UK\n1:24:34 Nottingham.

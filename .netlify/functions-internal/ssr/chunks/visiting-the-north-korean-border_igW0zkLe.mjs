const data = {name:"VISITING THE NORTH KOREAN BORDER",description:"Whilst visiting South Korea I got the chance to visit the border with North Korea. The DMZ is separation between the two Koreas and one of the most heavily fortified areas on earth. Come with me on this tour within the DMZ, you'll see into North Korea, the freedom bridge, international Korea railway station and an infiltration tunnel. \n\nThis was quite the experience and I would recommend this whilst visiting Seoul as it's a half day tour. A truly unique opportunity. \n\nMusic Used\nSong: Panuma - Skin (Metro Remix) (Vlog No Copyright Music)\nMusic provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.\nVideo Link: https://youtu.be/gYMDwxWUUYg",source:"youtube",source_id:"LRlO5QQxbOg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1551635382000)};

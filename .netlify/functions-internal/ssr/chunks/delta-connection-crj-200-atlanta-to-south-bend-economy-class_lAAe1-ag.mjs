const data = {name:"Delta Connection CRJ-200, Atlanta to South Bend, Economy Class",description:"Uh-oh....a really bad experience here!\n\nJoin me on this short trip from Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport to South Bend Regional, Indiana. Come along for the four hour delay....(don't worry, I edited that out!). Delta dropped the ball on this one. There were ongoing weather delays but we were pushed around gates and the passenger information was really poor. To cap it all, Delta only gives lounge access to customers on international itineraries, so my SkyTeam Gold membership was useless.\n\nBUT - this video includes a low and fast approach into South Bend at night, and some very worrying wake turbulence on takeoff! \n\nI'm not sure I'll be using Delta again in a hurry. Have you had problems with Delta, or was I unlucky here?\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"CJm-ZWx6Ops",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1473675936000)};

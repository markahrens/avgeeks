const data = {name:"Inaugural Flight! Lufthansa Airbus A350-900 Arrival at Montréal (YUL) Airport",description:"On April 1st, Lufthansa switched its Munich - Montréal flight from an A330 to a new Airbus A350, making this inaugural flight the first ever visit of an A350 in Montréal!\n\nHere we have D-AIXM, also the first video of Lufthansa's new livery on my channel, landing on 24L and taxiing past a gorgeous sunset to the gate. A bit disappointed in the lack of a water salute, seeing how frequently YUL does them!\n\nAs I mention at the start of the video, I also hit 20,000 subscribers on the channel just a few days ago! Thank you so much for all of your support, especially these past four months where I've been trying some new things. Much more to come!\n\nUntil then, enjoy this A350 :)\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Lufthansa (DLH/LH)\nAircraft: Airbus A350-900 (A359)\nFlight Number: LH474\nLivery: New (2018)\nEngines: 2x RR Trent XWB\nRegistration: D-AIXM\nRoute: Munich (MUC) - Montreal-Trudeau (YUL)\nCallsign: LUFTHANSA 4 JULIET HEAVY\nRunway used: 24L\nDate filmed: April 1, 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",source:"youtube",source_id:"QXCgE8v-Rac",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1555628402000)};

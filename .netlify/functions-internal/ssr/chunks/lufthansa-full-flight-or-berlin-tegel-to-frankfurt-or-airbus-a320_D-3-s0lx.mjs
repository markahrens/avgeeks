We are welcomed aboard before we push back and taxi out to runway 08R.  We lift off into a beautiful clear winter morning, making a right turn to get a fantastic view of snow-covered Berlin, with a great view of Tegel Airport and the former airport of Tempelhof.  We make a track south towards Frankfurt over a snow-covered Germany, climbing to a cruising altitude of 28,000ft for the short flight.  As we approach Frankfurt, the snow abruptly ends, and we make our approach for a smooth landing on runway 07L, before making our lengthy taxi into the terminal from the remote runway.  Once on stand, we disembark into the terminal.\n\nVideo taken from seat 24F.\n\nAirline:  Lufthansa\nFlight:  LH179\nAircraft:  Airbus A320 (Sharklets) D-AIZX\nFrom:  Berlin Tegel (TXL)\nTo:  Frankfurt Main (FRA)\nDeparture:  09:18\nArrival:  10:14\nFlight Time:  00:56\nSeat:  24F\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/5F5pJn\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

So, to position between Geneva in Switzerland and Las Palmas in Gran Canaria, I decided to book (as part of a wider multi city fare) this flight with them. \n\nIberia are part of the IAG group of airlines. Sadly this means they‚Äôre victim to some of the cost cutting practices British Airways have also been perpetrating. The breakfast was not well presented (apple slices in a plastic bag? Hmm), although the quality was acceptable and the coffee was good. I was pleasantly surprised at the generous amount of seatback storage though - it‚Äôs not often I can fit all of my recording gear and chargers into a seat pocket. The new seating including charge points is also very welcome!\n\nOverall a pretty average flight, somewhere in the middle in terms of quality with European business class. \n\nA big thanks to all of my subscribers for clicking that button and for sticking with me - do check out out the BA97 link above for some juicy details of some very exciting trips to come this summer (not included are trains...I have some *real crackers* to come there too!). \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips. I‚Äôve started using it properly now and it would be great to see some of you there too. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

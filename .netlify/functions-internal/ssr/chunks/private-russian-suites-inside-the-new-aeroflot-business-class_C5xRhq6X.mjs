const data = {name:"PRIVATE RUSSIAN SUITES: Inside the NEW Aeroflot Business Class",description:"Enter for the chance to win First-Class plane tickets (worth up to $20,000!) for your next big trip and support a great cause at https://omaze.com/trektrendy\n\nToday I’m onboard Aeroflot and their brand new Business Class suites, flown exclusively on their Airbus A350. Given that only a few of their A350’s have been delivered and are flying, this is quite the exclusive look onboard. \n\nI’m flying today from Dubai international airport over to Moscow’s Sheremetyevo. This will be a day flight so as well as reviewing the new suite, i'll look at what food service is provided, the bedding and overall experience in this rare to YouTube insight. \n\nSlight spoiler of course, but my initial impressions of this product were more in line with the hard product of First Class rather than business. As always I'll be benchmarking this product against other recently flown airlines like Air Canada, Qatar Airways and soon to be uploaded Singapore airlines. \n\nFollow my travels live on IG: will.luxurytravel",source:"youtube",source_id:"d3xyIpYaACU",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1626123091000)};

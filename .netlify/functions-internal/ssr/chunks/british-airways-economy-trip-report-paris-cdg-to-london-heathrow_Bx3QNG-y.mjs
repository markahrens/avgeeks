For those of you who are interested, this occurred directly after my Eurostar train to Paris, the report for which you can view here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OfbQJGH7V-Q Which do you prefer?\n\nMy British Airways Gold card allowed me into the Cathay Pacific Business Class Lounge at CDG. I love Cathay as an airline and I‚Äôm buzzing at having the opportunity to fly them on their ultra long haul Hong Kong to New York (via Vancouver) route in just six weeks‚Äô time! I massively appreciate the good quality of food on offer in the lounge, as BA don‚Äôt offer free catering any more in economy class. \n\nAs far as the flight goes, it was absolutely fine. The journey was punctual and despite some turbulence on departure from Paris, I even managed to sneak in an unplanned 20 minute nap (long day!!). Reward Flight Saver using Avios remains excellent value, at 4000 Avios plus a fixed ¬£17.50 cap on taxes and fees. I‚Äôm pretty happy at the value the flight delivered here. The only downside? Arriving at the B gates at Heathrow, meaning a boring transit underground to actually reach arrivals. Oh well - you can‚Äôt have it all. \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

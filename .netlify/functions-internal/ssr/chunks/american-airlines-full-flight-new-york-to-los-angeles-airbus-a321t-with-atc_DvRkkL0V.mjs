We push back and taxi to the runway making a beautiful departure out over New York.  We head towards Toronto in Canada, before the clouds clear and we are treated to a beautiful view of the United States for the remainder of the flight.  We fly across Lake Erie and Michigan, crossing Lake Michigan towards Wisconsin.  We then fly over Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado with a beautiful view of the entire midwest, crossing overhead Denver.  We then head down across Utah and Nevada getting a fantastic view of the Rockies and then the Grand Canyon, and Las Vegas.  We then cross the San Bernadino Mountains into the Los Angeles area, making a beautiful approach over the city on a beautiful clear morning.  Our viewing pleasure is extended as we make a go-around, before flying over the bay and getting a fantastic flight around Los Angeles for our second approach.\n\nOnce we land we are subject to ground delays for a short time; we finally make it onto stand around 20 minutes late.\n\nHighlights of flight: (California section thanks to Tim Alcoser):\n\n00:09:00   Walking to the gate in JFK\n00:01:30   Boarding the aircraft\n00:20:18   Pushback, commence taxi to runway 31L\n00:32:00   Line up and takeoff from runway 31L\n00:36:30   Atlantic Beach, NY\n00:44:37   White Plains, NY\n01:39:16   Lake Huron, Canada\n01:48:27   Flint, MI\n02:02:41   Muskegon, MI\n02:08:15   Lake Michigan\n02:12:01   Milwaukee, WI\n02:21:00   Madison, WI\n02:30:13   Dubuque, IA\n02:47:40   Des Moines, IA\n03:02:30   Omaha, NE\n03:38:00   Passenger in the row ahead advises crew they are feeling unwell\n03:39:40   Cabin crew call for doctor\n03:41:00   Cabin crew put out second call for doctor, nurse or EMT\n03:43:35   Cabin crew ask everyone in the main cabin to remain seated while they attend to the sick passenger\n04:00:15   Denver, CO\n04:07:00   Beginning of Rocky Mountains\n04:09:45   Mt Lincoln, CO\n04:16:00   Aspen, CO\n04:32:29   Moab, UT\n05:10:59   United 777 routing San Francisco-Houston, passing 1,000ft below over Lake Mead\n05:16:12   Las Vegas, NV\n05:35:35   Victorville, CA\n05:37:34 - Lake Arrowhead\n05:39:45 - KSBO, Santa Ana River and City of San Bernardino\n05:40:41   Final approach into LAX runway 24L\n05:41:00 - Cajon Pass\n05:42:08 - Auto Club Speedway and West Valley Detention Center\n05:43:00   Commencing approach into Los Angeles\n05:44:00 - Upland, Claremont Colleges and Mt.

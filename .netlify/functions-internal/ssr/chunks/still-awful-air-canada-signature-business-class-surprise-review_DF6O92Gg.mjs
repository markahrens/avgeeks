Air Canada Signature BUSINESS CLASS *Surprise Review!*",description:"Head to https://squarespace.com/trektrendy to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain using code TREKTRENDY\n\nIs Air Canada still awful? Today i'm flying Air Canada in a surprise review onboard their Boeing 787 Dreamliner. After my last awful experience, it's time to find out how they perform with their reintroduced Signature Business Class product. I'll be departing from their flagship Toronto YYZ airport and, as i'm now allowed to enter Canada i'll be reviewing their ground experience, lounges all whilst maintaining a low profile. The aim today is to not have the same issues as last time (see previous review) or indeed the curated PR flight I was presented with back in June. \n\nMy trip report today will encompass all elements of the onboard experience, food service, bedding, a seat tour and in this instance how 'friendly' the crew are. As usual i'm totally honest and open about my travel, so you'll see this though the lense of an ordinary passenger rather than certain YouTuber's who give an unrealistic advertorial walk through of their flights..\n\nAs always let me know what you think in the comments below, do you have a recent experience with Air Canada Business Class? How does this change your view on my previous awful experience?\n\nFollow along with my travels live on IG: https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel\n\nThe gear I use to produce these reviews:\n\nGoPro Hero 8 https://amzn.to/3A6Eu2j\nBattery pack https://amzn.to/3C8t27b\nCannon G7X https://amzn.to/3noKxM9\nGorillaPod https://amzn.to/3z3hwYS\n4TB rugged hardrive: https://amzn.to/3z4zfin\n128GB Microsd https://amzn.to/3C8t27b",source:"youtube",source_id:"g1g6m2_xSf0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1634504412000)};

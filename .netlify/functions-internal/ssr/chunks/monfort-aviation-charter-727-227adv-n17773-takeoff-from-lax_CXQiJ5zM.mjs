const data = {name:"Monfort Aviation Charter 727-227Adv [N17773] Takeoff From LAX ᴴᴰ",description:"Happy 4th of July to all of my American subscribers! \nNow, I have absolutely no idea whether this is rare or not :P As far as seeing a passenger 727 goes however, it's pretty rare, no matter what the airport is. Apologies for the lack of takeoff roll footage, I didn't see this bird until the last second. That's one of the hazards of Imperial Hill. I missed a United 787 because I wasn't paying attention :/ Hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

It's a night flight so gives me the chance to really test out the Air New Zealand bed - or should I say Air New Zealand Dorm in the Sky. \n\nThe design of the Air NZ business class seat and cabin is unique to say the least.  Each business class seat faces inwards, away from the window and towards your fellow passengers.  It makes for a very social flight and within minutes I'd made some new friends. \n\n12 hours on Air New Zealand's Dorm in the Sky is the ultimate Air NZ business class flight review. \n\nJoin me and let's fly to the US together. \n\nHappy Travels\n\nDennis\n\nPS here's the link to my earlier flight from Melbourne to Auckland: https://youtu.be/GE3T5eA89YY\n\n#airNZ #airnewzealand #AirNZUSA\n\n\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:00 Boarding\n01:30 Cheers Here's to a Great Flight\n02:41 Cabin Design\n04:20 The Seats\n05:31 Dashlane\n06:44 Drink and Dinner\n08:07 The Kid's Meal\n08:50 Amenities Kit\n09:08 The Bed\n10:14 Breakfast\n10:29 Entertainment System\n11:01 Landing",source:"youtube",source_id:"AUc88_aYFk8",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1662215792000)};

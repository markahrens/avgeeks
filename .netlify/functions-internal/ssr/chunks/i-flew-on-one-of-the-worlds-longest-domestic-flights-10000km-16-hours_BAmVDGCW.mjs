We're closing the year with an unusual flight, which travels from Mayotte to Reunion and on to Metropolitan France. All of those places are part of France (France treats its overseas departments as literally part of France, you see!), so this happens to be one of the world's longest and most unique domestic flights. The longest? Also French! Paris to Tahiti, operated by Air France and Frenchbee.

They often criticise the fact they attached ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù to the name. But then again, not many people I‚Äôve spoken to have actually flown from there!\n\nIt‚Äôs actually a very smart and efficient regional airport. Add in the fact that it has its own railway station with a direct link to London, a mere stone‚Äôs throw from the terminal, a 4* hotel round the corner, and the fact it isn‚Äôt Gatwick or Stansted and you‚Äôve got a pretty pleasant experience. I hadn‚Äôt been through Southend for a few years and it was good to be back. Regional airports are a good thing and we‚Äôre lucky to have plenty of them in Britain - including some top class ones like Newcastle and Southampton. \n\nThe ATR is a great aircraft. I like the quirk that you board from the rear - this makes seats near the back unusually prized, though many people still select front seats out of habit. On this trip I had yet another empty seat next to me. I‚Äôm on quite a roll at the moment. \n\nThis was a perfectly calm winter‚Äôs afternoon. A good day to be flying, especially as cruising took place at just 16,000 feet. There are a number of old airfields and landmarks I point out along the way, as usual...\n\n**Very special thanks to Elliot Szlato, a subscriber and Snapchat follower, who generously offered me a promotional code he wasn‚Äôt able to use. Southend Airport had been offering free flights to promote this very new route from the airport. Much appreciated!**\n\nI have lots of videos coming out, including in midweek in the run up to New Year. This is to use up all my reports shot on iPhone before I start afresh in January 2018 with a proper camera.

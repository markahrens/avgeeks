const data = {name:"Skydiving Flight - Skydive Deland PAC750, Complete Flight",description:"I was lucky to go along for a ride onboard Skydive Deland's Pacific Aerospace PAC750 from Deland Airport, Florida, to drop skydivers.  We took off from Deland, climbed initially to 5,000ft and dropped the first load, before climbing further to 14,000ft and dropping the rest.  We then nosedived to the ground, and were back on the ground before the last skydivers!  This was a very exciting flight and great fun to do, the video is the complete flight from boarding the aircraft to getting off again on the ground.  \n\nEnjoy the ride and feel free to subscribe for more!\n\nGoPro Hero 3\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

const data = {name:"First Visit! Air Canada New Livery A321-211 [C-GJWI] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport",description:"On February 9th 2017, Air Canada unveiled their new livery which incorporates a number of unique elements that all represent Canadian culture. I decided to reserve my judgement until having seen it in person, and I have to say, I think this livery fits very well. Anyway, here we have one of the three first aircraft painted, a 787-8, C-GHPQ (my personal favorite 787), and two A321s, C-GJWO and C-GJWI (as seen here). This was the first visit of the new livery to YYC; a pretty significant moment as this is one of the most common liveries we'll be seeing for the next several years. ATC is included, along with a tower controller who seems to be very excited to see it for the first time ;) ENJOY!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Airbus A321-200 (A321)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: 2017\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-5B3/P\nRegistration: C-GJWI\nRoute: YYZ-YYC-YYZ\nCallsign: Air Canada 119 and 128\nRunway used: 29 and 29\nLocal Time: 1230 and 1330\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGJWI\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2017\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"6qJBrUEMg20",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1486873149000)};

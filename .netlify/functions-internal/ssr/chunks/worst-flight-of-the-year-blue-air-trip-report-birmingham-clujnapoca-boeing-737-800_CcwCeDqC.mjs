I‚Äôm positive about travel and although I try to remain honest, I‚Äôll always be upbeat about what I‚Äôm doing where I can. After all, nobody wants to watch some guy flying round the world telling people week in week out how much it all sucks. But today‚Äôs report is an exception, because this was undeniably a completely rubbish experience and Blue Air don‚Äôt really care in my opinion. \n\nI won‚Äôt waffle on in long paragraphs, just read this list of why it sucked:\n\nBIRMINGHAM AIRPORT:\n\n- Airport/station shuttle not working. No staff to explain why or how to get to the airport. Found my own way after giving up. No signposted route from the shuttle so it took me 30 minutes to walk trailing my bag. \n- Awful, awful security line. Never seen it so bad at Birmingham, a normally good airport - and an airport I would normally advocate for. No idea what the issue was. Spent ¬£5 to go fast track. Irritating. \n\nBLUE AIR:\n\n- Check in is contracted out to a third party. Agent wasn‚Äôt sure if my bag would be through checked to Bucharest, my final destination or whether I‚Äôd need to collect and recheck in Cluj. So I wasted 30 minutes in Cluj watching all the bags come out before concluding that it was indeed through checked. \n- Boarding nonsense. Blue Air don‚Äôt have a monopoly on this trick, but I really really hate ‚Äúboarding‚Äù and then waiting on a freezing cold/boiling hot airbridge while the aircraft actually gets ready. That‚Äôs plain inhospitable - keep us in the terminal where it is room temperature and don‚Äôt wind people up doing this!\n- Tired cabin with obvious lack of maintenance on an older airframe. \n- Inexplicably small storage net on the seat backs. \n- Some of the worst scratches on a window I‚Äôve ever seen. This made filming very hard when the sun was at certain angles. This meant I‚Äôve had to make a decision not to use significant portions of footage including the takeoff roll (which is normally a mandatory part of my videos). Sorry if you like the takeoffs; I do too, but you couldn‚Äôt see anything and the footage was totally unusable. I don‚Äôt put stuff out that‚Äôs unwatchable. \n- DIDN‚ÄôT GET WHAT I PAID FOR - my meal wasn‚Äôt loaded. That was my dinner, and I‚Äôd paid for the meal as part of my fare. The crew did not even seem aware I was supposed to have a meal even though it‚Äôs in my booking confirmation and AVML was printed on my boarding card confirming this (for geeks: yes, AVML is Asian vegetarian meal but budget airlines use these codes to just denote ‚Äúthis guy‚Äôs ordered a standard meal‚Äù). \n- Inappropriate material in an inflight magazine which will be read by children. Very surprised to see that if I‚Äôm honest. I found it hilarious, but also recognise that stuff ought not to be in an inflight magazine...\n- Had a seat change without prior notification on my connecting flight, CLJ-OTP. Window to aisle. Luckily that was not a trip I planned to make a video on but I hate aisle seats and given my fare was top whack and included ‚Äúpreferential‚Äù seating it sucked more than usual. \n- Went to complain at Blue Air‚Äôs website. The complaint field on the contact form has space for just 140 characters, the same as an old style Twitter message. Yep, condense the above into 140 characters to complain. This is the worst part in my opinion. It sums up the whole experience. Maddening, illogical, and not customer friendly. \n\nI actively chastise people who turn their nose up at budget carriers but this poor experience was a shock to the system. \n\nI have lots of videos coming out, including in midweek in the run up to New Year. Make sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

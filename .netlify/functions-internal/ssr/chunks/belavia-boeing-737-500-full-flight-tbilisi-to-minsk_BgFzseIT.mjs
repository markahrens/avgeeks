const data = {name:"Belavia Boeing 737-500 Full Flight: Tbilisi to Minsk",description:"A full uncut flight on Belavia from Tbilisi, Georgia to Minsk, Belarus, onboard Boeing 737-500 EW-294PA operating flight B2736 on 29 May 2015.  Every minute included from boarding to deboarding.  Apologies for the state of the scratched window on this 20-year old airframe!\n\nWe board the flight at 3am in Tbilisi for an ontime departure at 3.45am.  Soon after takeoff the sun starts to rise off in the east, as we route over Russia towards Moscow, to avoid the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine.  We are treated to a beautiful sunrise as we route north, before turning towards our destination, Minsk.  As we cross the Belarusian border we make a series of turns to avoid some huge storms, before commencing our descent and making an early arrival into Minsk.\n\nVideo taken from seat 13A.\n\nAirline:  Belavia\nFlight:  B2736\nAircraft:  Boeing 737-500 EW-294PA\nFrom:  Tbilisi (TBS)\nTo:  Minsk (MSQ)\nDeparture:  03:45\nArrival:  05:21\nFlight Time:  02:36\nSeat:  9F\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/Q6iv0H\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

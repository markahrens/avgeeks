const data = {name:"DC's National Airport - NEW Concourse, Gate 35X, Gravelly Point Park",description:"In this video, we’ll explore one of my favorite airports in the United States: Washington’s National Airport. \n\nIf you're considering a trip to National Airport, check out this video first to learn a little bit about this airport! This Washington DC Travel Guide will give you the inside scoop on this airport!\n\nAlong the way, we’ll check out \n\n- Gravelly Point Park, a unique vantage point for spotting planes near National Airport, \n- Take an unusual means of transportation to the National Airport,\n- Pay our respects to National Airport's dearly departed Gate 35X, and \n- Check out the brand New Concourse that’s just opened at DCA Airport.\n\nDCA Airport is the most convenient airport to Washington DC. In fact, it's so convenient, it's possible to walk there! \n\nGravelly Point Park Plane Spotting is one the best experiences an aviation enthusiast can have! \n\nThanks to the Mount Vernon Trail, you can walk all the way from Washington DC's city center to National Airport! Not many cities in the USA can boast that! (I'll also share a bit about how you can drive or use the Washington DC Metro to reach National Airport.)\n\nNational Airport's Gate 35X is a dreaded place for many passengers who've had awful experiences there. But, as much was we hated it...it was still \"our\" gate, so in this video I show my respect to DC Airport's Gate 35X!\n\nDo you think DCA Airport should be used as a hub airport? Let me know in the comments below.\n\nAlso, to longtime Washington, DC residents, it'll always be Washington National Airport. But its full name is Washington Reagan National Airport. Some people call it Reagan National Airport, while others prefer DCA Airport.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n3:09 Getting to DCA Airport\n5:07 Saying Goodbye to Gate 35X\n7:06 Exploring DCA Airport’s New Concourse\n\nHere’s my video about Washington's Airports - Washington Dulles Airport Video:\nhttps://youtu.be/IQ4sfru9b3I\n\nAirports Revealed:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFeqB0_phJSzjYPxTUDaQ8xNC\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n \nMusic:\nStories – Tape Machines\nSaturday Coffee – William Claeson\nGlitching Through the Sky – William Benckert\nAn Easier Walk – View Points\nStyle At Home – Kikoru\nFuneral for a Flower – Sage Oursler\nPresent (Instrumental Version) – Adelyn Paik\nNew Found Love – Raymond Grouse\nSparkling Trace – Raymond Grouse\nThe Street Performer (Sting) – Martin Gauffin",source:"youtube",source_id:"rlKckgYFqPU",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1621094433000)};

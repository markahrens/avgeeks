const data = {name:"HEAVY CARGO in EDMONTON | MD-11F, An-124, and MORE!",description:"In recent months, Edmonton International Airport has become a cargo hub of sorts, with multiple heavy cargo visitors each week, all carrying PPE to assist in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nI made the drive to (safely) capture a few of these unique visitors, mainly, some FedEx MD-11s, which are an extremely rare sight here in Alberta.\n\nI also lucked out by catching that UPS MD-11F taxiing by to do some engine runs - it diverted to Edmonton while en route from Louisville to Anchorage, when it encountered an oil issue over northern Alberta. Presumably, the issue turned out to be more serious than anticipated and it stayed for over 5 days, and a UPS 747 (not in the video) was flown in to take the cargo onwards.\n\nThe second FedEx MD-11 as well as the D228 and B732 were filmed on a separate day.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

Welcome to the NEW Kansas City International Airport!\n\nConstruction began on the MCI Airport Terminal in March 2019. The building is more than 1 million square feet, cost 1.5 billion dollars, and was completed on budget and a day earlier than planned.\n\nIn this Airports Revealed video, we’ll explore the  World's Newest Airport Terminal at Kansas City International Airport! \n\nWe'll look at the passenger experience from beginning to end. We’ll even look inside the old Kansas City International KCI Airport terminal design to understand what it’s replacing.\n\nThe New MCI Airport is just one of so many exciting New Airport Terminal projects going on all over the United States and we had so much fun exploring the new KCI Terminal when it opened on Tuesday, February 28, 2023!\n\nThere are 39 gates at KCI Airport with room to expand to 50! While the security features of the old terminals left A LOT to be desired, the new set-up is smooth with 16 lanes! It took us no time at all to get through the Airport experience. I even had time to get an airport haircut!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:36 Old Kansas City Terminal\n2:49 New Kansas City Terminal\n10:20 Final Thoughts\n\nMore #AirportsRevealed Videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFeqB0_phJSzjYPxTUDaQ8xNC\n \nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com\n \nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies\n \nCheck me out on Twitter, too:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n \nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n \nMusic:\nMove Your Body (Hallman Remix) (Instrumental Version) - Loving Caliber\nWhat Do We Do To Love (Instrumental Version) - Hallman\nAnten Before Dawn - Candelion\nKings Of The World (Instrumental Version) - Aiyo\nWhat Surrounds Us - Tomas Skyldeberg\nYouTook Me Somewhere New - Rain Jewels",source:"youtube",source_id:"NsfHwLVzFhM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1677945611000)};

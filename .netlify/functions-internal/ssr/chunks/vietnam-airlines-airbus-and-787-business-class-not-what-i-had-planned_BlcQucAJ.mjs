const data = {name:"Vietnam Airlines Airbus and 787 Business Class - Not What I Had Planned",description:"Vietnam Airlines’ Long-Haul Business Class has been high on my list to fly for a long time. Vietnam Airlines is a member of the SkyTeam Alliance, but that was about all I knew about Vietnam Airlines. \n\nSo, when I recently needed to travel from Shanghai to Frankfurt, I discovered the perfect itinerary with Vietnam Airlines with a layover in Ho Chi Minh City. The first leg, from Shanghai to Ho Chi Minh City, would be operated by one of Vietnam Airlines’ A350’s (my favorite airplane!). The second, from Ho Chi Minh City to Frankfurt, would involve a Vietnam Airlines Boeing 787. What a great comparison of two rival aircraft, both operated by the same carrier – Vietnam Airlines.\n\nUnfortunately, Vietnam Airlines had something else in store for me…\n\nIn the end, thanks to an unexpected Equipment Swap, I got the chance to try out Vietnam Airlines’ Airbus A321 Business Class on the first leg as well as Vietnam Airlines 787 Business Class on the second one.\n\nJoin me on this review of Vietnam Airlines’ long-haul business class. We’ll explore Vietnam Airlines’ lounge, Vietnam Airlines’ business class seat, Vietnam Airlines inflight entertainment, Vietnam Airlines’ food, and Vietnam Airlines’ crew! I’ll even give Vietnam Airlines a “JebScore!”\n\nI can’t wait to return to Vietnam and try Vietnam Airlines again. What do you think? Leave a comment and let me know your thoughts on Vietnam Airlines! \n\nHere's a link to the unedited take-off and landing footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/YCAUreSqJ08\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nChai – Saira Ridley\nWorld Joy – Saira Ridley\nRise of the Red Sun – Mandala Dreams",source:"youtube",source_id:"rYlJ6JqrKX8",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1564838700000)};

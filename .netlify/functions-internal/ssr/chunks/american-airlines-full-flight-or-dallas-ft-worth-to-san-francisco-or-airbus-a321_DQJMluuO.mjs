We push back from the stand and takeoff from runway 18R on a beautiful clear summer morning.  We make a right turn after departure to climb out over Northern Texas towards Amarillo, TX as we climb to our cruising altitude of 34,000ft.\n\nWe get a stunning view of Texas and New Mexico, passing to the north of Santa FE, NM and across to the border with Utah.  We get some great views of the Navajo Nation and the Dixie National Forest, before crossing into Nevada.  Our scenic flight across the South West has one more delight for us - we pass Yosemite getting a fantastic view of the entire park before descending across Northern California into San Francisco, where we make a beautiful approach and landing to runway 28R.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:04:24  Pushback and engine start\n0:14:04  Line up runway 18R\n0:15:26  Takeoff runway 18R\n3:16:50  Final approach to runway 28R\n3:20:32  Touchdown runway 28R\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"3umrORzrOy4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1503061190000)};

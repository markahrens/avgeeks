In this video, you'll see some of the highlights of Delta Air Lines' Flight Museum. We'll check out the: \n\n- Delta Flight Museum Boeing 747, \n- Delta Flight Museum 767, \n- Take a look at the Delta Flight Museum Simulator,\n- The Delta Flight Museum DC-3\n- The Delta Flight Museum Convair 880 prototype cockpit.\n\nThere are tons of exhibits including tons of airplane models. \n\nThis is one of the coolest commercial aviation flight museums I've visited. The highlight for me was probably getting to go inside the retired Delta Air Lines Boeing 747, but the \"Spirit of Delta'\" Boeing 767 was also very cool. What do you think the best part of the museum was?

const data = {name:"Virgin Atlantic 747 Full Flight Experience (Orlando - Glasgow) Upper Deck!",description:"Thanks for watching this Full Flight Experience!  In May 2017 I had the opportunity to take a research trip to the Highlands of Scotland and experience some of my favorite locales in the world!  There were plenty of opportunities for walking, exploring, and recording my discoveries, and the fun started even before I arrived.\n\nThis six-part journey reaches a high point as I fly Virgin Atlantic for the first time; a Virgin Atlantic virgin.  This seasonal route from Orlando International Airport to Glasgow International Airport had just begun, and it delivered me to my destination in style! This flight involves an upper deck economy seat experience on a classy Boeing 747, with great views of the bright red wing and engines, and beautiful mid-spring scenery on the East Coast of the U.S. and dawn over the wild Scottish islands. Taking this flight, with its all-Scottish crew, refreshed me on the joys and quirks of Scottish culture!\n\nI never tire of flying on an original queen of the skies, and this time was no exception. The service, food, and comfort were an excellent welcome on my way to Scotland! I hope you enjoy the trip across the ocean, too! \n\nThanks for flying in, and stay tuned for the upcoming legs of this journey to and from the British Isles!\n\nThumbnail by my wife Beth! \nInstagram at bethmclain.art\n\n--------------------------------\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: Virgin Atlantic\nFlight Number: VIR72\nDate of Flight: Saturday, May 6th, 2017\n\nOrigin Airport: Orlando International Airport (KMCO/MCO)\nDestination Airport: Glasgow International Airport (EGPF/GLA)\n\nDeparting Gate: 94\nBoarding Time: 17:12 EDT\nScheduled Departure: 17:50 EDT\nActual Departure from Gate: 17:49 EDT\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 35L / 18:01 EDT\n\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 05 / 06:29 BST\nScheduled Arrival: 06:40 BST\nActual Arrival at Gate: 06:36 BST\nArriving Gate: 33\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAircraft Information\nType: Boeing 747-400\nRegistration: G-VROM \nAircraft Delivery: May 2012\nEngines: 4x CF6-80\nSeat: 80K\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\nCanon Vixia HFM30\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView\n\nAircraft, flight information, and facts developed from Planespotters.net.\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

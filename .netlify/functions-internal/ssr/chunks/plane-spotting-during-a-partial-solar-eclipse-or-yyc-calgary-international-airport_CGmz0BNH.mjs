const data = {name:"Plane Spotting During a Partial Solar Eclipse | YYC Calgary International Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"As virtually everyone is aware, on August 21, 2017, a complete solar eclipse was visible across the entire continent of North America. In Calgary, 80% of the sun was covered by the moon. With that in mind, I thought it would be a good idea to film some regular action at YYC during this rare event. While we weren't in the path of totality, at the time of maximum coverage, it was definitely darker than usual, a bit of an eerie sensation when the sky is perfectly clear. You'll notice the clips of WestJet's \"Magic Plane\" and the Air Canada 767 are a bit darker than usual; those were both taken right at the time of maximum coverage. In Calgary, the eclipse started at 1020 local time and ended at 1250. The clips in this video were all taken all throughout that 2.5 hour period and are arranged chronologically. Enjoy this 14 minute compilation of some plane spotting during one of nature's most spectacular events.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"SsJr-exN5kk",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1503381546000)};

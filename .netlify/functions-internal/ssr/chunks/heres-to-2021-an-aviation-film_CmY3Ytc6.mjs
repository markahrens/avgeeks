const data = {name:"Here's to 2021 - An Aviation Film",description:"So, that was 2020. A year which changed the world and the aviation industry drastically.\n\nNevertheless, there were a few notable moments, which I've compiled into this short aviation film, celebrating the best of 2019 and 2020 (what few parts there were).\n\nIn early 2020, I fortunately got in quite a few flights, including the inaugural Air Canada A220 flight from Calgary with @Vuelogs , the trip to Atlanta to fly on the Delta MD-88, and later to Manchester on board the Air Transat A310, and subsequently a fantastic few days with @JonathanWinton123 and @Mraviationguy !\n\nOf course, everything changed after that, but there were some high points in the form of charter and cargo flights, as well as a few domestic trips of my own over the summer. Spending 2 months in Edmonton as well, I managed to get my private pilot's license, and I'm now working on my commercial one!\n\nSo - far from a good year, but definitely a few high points. Thank you for all of your support, and here's to 2021!\n\nMusic - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

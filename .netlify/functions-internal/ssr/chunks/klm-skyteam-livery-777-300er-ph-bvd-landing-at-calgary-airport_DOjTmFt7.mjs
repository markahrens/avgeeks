const data = {name:"KLM SkyTeam Livery 777-300ER [PH-BVD] Landing at Calgary Airport",description:"This has been on my list for a LONG time now! With the visit of \"Orange Pride\" last summer, there was just one last 77W in KLM's fleet that just had to be caught, PH-BVD, their sole 777 in the SkyTeam airline alliance livery. The SkyTeam livery in general is a pretty rare sight here, simply because the SkyTeam airlines that fly here (Delta, KLM) just don't regularly serve us with those aircraft that have it (in KLM's case, the A330/B789/B772). But ever since we started getting 77W substitutions, I had always hoped that BVD would make its way here, and finally it did this afternoon! Hope you enjoy this special catch!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM/KL)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-306/ER (B77W)\nAircraft Name: \"Nationaal Park Amboseli / Amboseli National Park\"\nLivery: SkyTeam (woo!)\nEngines: 2x GE90-115B\nRegistration: PH-BVA\nRoute: Amsterdam-Schiphol (AMS) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: KLM 677 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: February 6, 2018\nLocal time: 1330\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/PHBVD\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"gPDPv1zE_n0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1517968297000)};

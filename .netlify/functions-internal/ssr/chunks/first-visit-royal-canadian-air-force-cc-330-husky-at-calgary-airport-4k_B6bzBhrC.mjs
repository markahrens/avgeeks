const data = {name:"FIRST VISIT! Royal Canadian Air Force CC-330 Husky at Calgary Airport! (4K)",description:"Last week, the newest addition to the Royal Canadian Air Force fleet visited Calgary for the first time ever! The CC-330 Husky is the RCAF's version of the Airbus A330 MRTT, and will serve as both a strategic transport and tanker aircraft.\n\nThese will replace Canada's existing fleet of 5 CC-150s, which is based on the older Airbus A310. In total, the RCAF is expected to take delivery of 9 CC-330s. 5 of those are used A330-200s, 4 of which will get converted to the MRTT standard at a later date, while the remaining 4 will be new-build A330MRTTs.\n\nThe 5 used ones, including this plane, are all relatively new, originally delivered to Kuwait Airways in 2015. This one will be used as Canada's new VIP transport, and was delivered to the RCAF at the end of August. Since then, it's been busy flying around the country seemingly on various training and familiarization flights.\n\nIt's great to finally see the CC-330 program come to life, and to see this one in the fantastic looking Government of Canada livery as well!

Here's a video with my thoughts on that situation: \nhttp://jeb.flights/travel\n\nThis video is about flying to the St. Helena Airport. St. Helena Airport is one of the most challenging airports in the world. Less than ten commercial airline pilots are certified to land here!\n\nAt either end of the runway are massive cliffs, which create challenging wind conditions. \n\nI’ve wanted to visit St. Helena for a long time. When the St. Helena Airport received its first commercial flight in 2017, the trip became far more viable for me. Before St. Helena Airport opened, a trip there required a five day boat trip just to get there. \n\nSt. Helena’s role in the Age of Exploration cannot be understated. The Portuguese used St. Helena as a secret base for restocking their ships (they left a heard of goats and planted citrus trees. It then became a key possession of the British East India Company before it was suddenly converted into a prison for the world’s most feared man – Napoleon. He died there, too. Today, it’s a fascinating British Overseas Territory accessed thanks to the St. Helena Airport.\n\nIn this video, we’ll explore the flight’s route, the passenger experience, and even peak behind the scenes at the St. Helena Airport to understand how it all works.\n\nHere’s a link to the unedited take-off and landing footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/oOjfglw93sw\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic: \nFeels Right – Cody Francis\nShe Folded a Paper Plane – Franz Gordon\nBig World for a Minnow – Trevor Kowalski\nStarting Again – Cody Francis\nLion’s Drift – Trevor Kowalski\nFair Fight – Martin Klem\nCome Find Me – Out Linear\nAlien Comedienne – Radio Night",source:"youtube",source_id:"8EaGRUdhZuY",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1586005209000)};

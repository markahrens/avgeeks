const data = {name:"First Air ATR 42-512 [C-FTIL] Landing at Edmonton Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"First Air is a small airline that serves Northern Canada with a fleet of Boeing 737-400s and ATR 42/72s primarily from bases in Yellowknife and Iqaluit. One of their busier routes is the Edmonton to Yellowknife route, sometimes operating two flights a day in competition with Canadian North. Here's one of their flights operated by the ATR 42 (my first time filming one, incidentally) arriving on runway 20 at Edmonton International Airport back in May.

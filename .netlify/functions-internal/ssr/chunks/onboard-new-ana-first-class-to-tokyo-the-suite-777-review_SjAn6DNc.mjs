I'll explain the process of what it's like to fly onboard The Suite during 2021 to Tokyo, Japan. This product is offered exclusively onboard their Boeing 777-300ER and only on a select few routes to London, Germany and the USA. My flight today is near empty, which incidentally means I’ll have the entirety of First Class to myself all the way to Japan.  \n\nIt's incidentally a super expensive First Class to fly, and until recently only bookable utilising a return miles redemption. As always I’ll walk you through a comprehensive trip report of the complete All Nippon Airways First Class experience from departure, lounge, onboard service, food, drink and the bed! Please let me know below what you think to this review and what other products you’d like to see in the future. \n\n\nRemember you can follow my travels live over on IG: will.luxurytravel",source:"youtube",source_id:"HHLy9Bspl2o",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1629669894000)};

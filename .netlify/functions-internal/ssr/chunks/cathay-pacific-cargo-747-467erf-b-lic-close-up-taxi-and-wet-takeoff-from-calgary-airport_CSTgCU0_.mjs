const data = {name:"Cathay Pacific Cargo 747-467ERF [B-LIC] Close Up Taxi and Wet Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Definitely some great weather for spotting ;) Here we have a change of aircraft from what Cathay normally brings into YYC, a 747-400 freighter instead of the larger -8. The dash 400 is no stranger to YYC by any means, with Cargolux and Atlas Air providing regular flights in and out every couple of days, but I don't believe a -400 from Cathay Pacific has ever been here. Either way, I'm still happy to have caught it, even though the weather was atrocious. As a result, that's the crackling sound you may hear in the background, from the heavy rain. On the plus side, it made for some great spray from B-LIC's 4 Pratt and Whitney engines. Another detail of interest is the change in taxiway, as the result of a temporary wingspan restriction on a part of the regular one. The crew was then required to use the parallel taxiway on my side of the runway, giving me a close up shot with some great engine sound too. It certainly made up for how cold and wet I was by the end of it! I hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!

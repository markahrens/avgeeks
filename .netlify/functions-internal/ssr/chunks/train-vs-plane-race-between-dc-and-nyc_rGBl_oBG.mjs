const data = {name:"Train vs. Plane RACE Between DC and NYC",description:"Can a train beat a plane?\n\nThere’s one place in the United States where trains and planes can compete. It’s the Northeastern Corridor of the country. \n\nThere, North America’s fastest train, the Acela, connects Washington, DC and Boston along with the urban centers along the route. The high-speed train reaches speeds up to 150 miles per hour, a remarkable pace in a country where every other train operates at relatively low speeds. \n\nTo compete, airlines offer regular flights among these cities with upgraded amenities. \n\nBut, can the speed of an airline overcome the comfort and pace of high-speed rail? \n\nJoin me in this video as we pit Acela against an Airplane in order to determine which mode of transportation is faster. \n\nI’ll also share more comparisons between the two, including the price. \n\n0:00 Introduction \n1:55 Boarding Acela \n5:26 Arriving at Penn Station \n6:51 Leaving for LaGuardia \n9:53 Boarding the Airplane \n12:07 Arriving into DCA \n12:31 Train v.

const data = {name:"Kalitta Air 747-400BCF [N741CK] Night Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Another rare catch! Here is one of Kalitta Air's 7 747-400s departing Calgary bound for Brize Norton. The video features a brief look at the aircraft parked, taxiing, and then taking off. The rotation is pretty spectacular in my opinion, along with that engine sound! This is also an airline I've never seen in real life before. so it was pretty cool. I hope you enjoy, watch in HD, and turn up your speakers for the sound of those 4 GE CF6s roaring overhead!\n\nThanks for watching!

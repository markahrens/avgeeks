This one doesn't. \nBut this one does feature a lion, a man shouting in the terminal, displays of air crashes before we flew, a ghost, a unique seat warmer and the most beautiful landing view I've ever captured.  \n\nAll that in one quick 7 minute flight review on an airline that is hard to define. \n\nIn today's world of code share flights and wet leases it can be difficult to know what airline you are actually flying.  This was one of those cases where even now I'm not sure what I actually flew on my flight between Casablanca Morocco and Lisbon Portugal.  \n\nI had booked TAP - Portugal's national airline. However my itinerary said it was operated by Air Bulgaria - something that was further confirmed by the safety card on board.  Yet the outside of the aircraft was painted in TAP Express livery.  Confused?  So am I!\n\nJoin me for the flight out of Morocco on a Bulgarian TAP!  You'll be in for some surprises. Not least of which was a display of aircraft crashes and rescues at Casablanca Airport!!\n\nThere are also some great views out the window and a magnificent ghost curtain protecting the business class passengers from the riff raff seated in economy. \n\nAll and all a memorable flight out of Morocco on a Bulgarian TAP!\n\nEnjoy and happy travels\n\nDennis\n\n#TAPPortugal #flightreview #Casablanca",source:"youtube",source_id:"YaGdQZ86H74",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1660473005000)};

But what are they like on the shorter regional routes? And how do the American carriers compare to the likes of flying Virgin Australia to Bali?\n\nJoin me as I fly from Miami to the Caribbean Island of Aruba on American Airlines in Business Class.  It's on an American Airlines Boeing 737 with a standard 2 by 2 narrow body business class. \n\nThis flight review covers the entire American Airlines experience from boarding to landing. I include the AA business class seat, the inflight dining, entertainment and some stunning views out the window as we fly out of Miami and straight over the top of Cuba. \n\nThen when we arrive I've included a bit of footage from our 2 days stay on this beautiful island. \n\nBy way of comparison here is my review of Virgin Australia from Melbourne to Bali: https://youtu.be/PnSZSrlLiq8\n\nThe best bit about this trip though is that I got to share with my brother Sacha who has his own travel related YouTube channel. Here's the link:  https://www.youtube.com/@thepart-timetourists\nMake sure you check it out!\n\nThanks for watching and happy travels\n\nDennis\n\n#americanairlines #aruba #flightreveiw",source:"youtube",source_id:"NhW9YNTxwcU",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1701598143000)};

What's the passenger experience like on a 30 year-old plane? Although most airplanes are well-maintained, the cabin in this Saab 340 was a reminder of another time in air travel!\n\nGuatemala City has service from many cities (including many in the United States) while the Flores airport is known as the gateway to the Mayan world. This means the route between the two airports is popular among tourists and locals, alike. \n\nThis short one-hour trip included great views of a Central American sunset as well as remarkable service. Not sure about you, but I *truly* enjoy flying on a propeller plane, so the chance to fly this old Saab 340 was truly special. In short, this service from TAG (Transportes AÃ©reos Guatemaltecos) was great! The flight attendant was cheery and helpful, the food was impressive for such a short flight, and the plane was incredible!\n\nThe only strange thing was boarding. Watch the video to see how an airline whose Saab 340 only has about 30 seats handles a route with demand for nearly 60 seats! It's a surprise!\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic: \nLatin Flavour 01 - Lars Olvmyr\nLatin Flavour 09 - Lars Olvmyr",source:"youtube",source_id:"7CpC1-n245M",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1521812239000)};

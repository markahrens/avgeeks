Find out more about them at https://www.radarbox.com/?referrer=AlexAviation\n\nLast week, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds demonstration team stopped in Calgary briefly, on their way back from spring training in Comox, B.C.! They came through Calgary for a quick fuel stop on their way back to home base in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.\n\nGreat to see the team flying again, and always a patriotic feeling to see 9 of them taking off at once!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nOperator: Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF)\nAircraft: Canadair CT-114 Tutor (x11)\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 1x Orenda J85-CAN-40\nRegistration: Many\nRoute: Kelowna (YLW) - Calgary (YYC) - Moose Jaw (YMJ)\nCallsign: Snowbird 10 Flight / Snowbird 1 Flight, etc.\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: May 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

const data = {name:"Reported to Security - My Jetstar Experience",description:"It started so well.  Until suddenly it went down hill pretty quickly. \n\nI was flying from Cairns to Adelaide with low-cost carrier Jetstar Airways which is part of the Qantas group.  This Jetstar flight review covers my total Jetstar Experience including when things took a turn and I was Reported to Security. \n\nIt was all going so well - I was really impressed by Cairns Airport; from their friendly security staff through to the many shops and dining options and the huge Qantas Club Lounge with its great views of the apron and airport operations. \n\nThen I headed to the gate and things went downhill quickly. Jetstar appears to randomly select flights where they weigh passenger's hand luggage - this was one of those flights.  Luckily my hand luggage was under the weight limit however the Jetstar employee managing this process didn't take too kindly to me filming the process - even though I wasn't filming her or any passenger's faces.  \n\nDespite my attempting to explain why I make these review - to promote travel and help inform travelers - things escalated quickly.  She reported me to management and I was stopped from boarding until I had been suitably berated by the manager and shown her my footage.  For good measure she advised me she would be reporting me to Qantas Security.  \n\nI've always maintained that every employee helps shape a company's culture and contributes positively or negatively to its brand experience.  My experience on this flight is the perfect example on how a couple of staff having a bad day can damage a brand.  Ultimately though we all know the buck stops with senior management and hopefully this video sparks the conversations that are sorely needed at Jetstar's head office.\n\nFor an example how these videos can be a positive for an airline and boost staff pride and morale at the same time check out my recent Air France flight review.

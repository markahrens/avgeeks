Featuring a visit to the Lufthansa Senator Lounge in Frankfurt too!\n\nOverall a perfectly acceptable flight – at least Lufthansa are still giving out *some* freebies in Economy…the less said about British Airways, the better…\n\nThere was some pretty spectacular turbulence on the way over too as well as a blustery Easterly approach into City airport…enjoy the video!\n\nDon’t forget to leave a comment and thumbs up!\n\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTHE LAST TIME I WAS IN FRANKFURT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HHuul6jGjM \n\n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek #frankfurt #lcy #lufthansa\n\nMusic: Joakim Karud – Something New\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",source:"youtube",source_id:"trAiqMT_6Lw",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1490793565000)};

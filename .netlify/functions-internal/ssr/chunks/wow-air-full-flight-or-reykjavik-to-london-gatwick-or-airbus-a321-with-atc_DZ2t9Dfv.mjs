We leave our shuttle and walk into the terminal, using the WOW Air Self Check In, and dropping our bag.  We then head to security and through to the departure lounge, before heading to the non-Schengen gates through passport control at the end of the terminal.  Our aircraft arrives from its inbound flight from Berlin-Schonefeld, and it isn't long before we're boarding through the jetway.  We take our seat in row 8 and are soon receiving our route clearance to Gatwick.  We push back from the terminal, making a departure from runway 10 before being cleared to climb straight to 29,000ft and heading across the North Atlantic.  \n\nWe enter a few patches of turbulence as we head on a track slightly west of usual, heading to the coast of Northern Ireland before crossing the Irish Sea to the Isle of Man.  From there we head towards Manchester and Birmingham, commencing our descent over cloudy skies.  We enter a holding pattern as we approach Gatwick Airport, before making an approach through the cloud, touching down smoothly on runway 26L at Gatwick.  We then taxi into the South Terminal underneath the Skybridge, before docking and disembarking through the forward doors.  We walk through the terminal to baggage claim, then through customs and emerge at the kerbside outside the terminal.\n\nTIMELINE:\n\n0:00:04  Driving into Keflavik Airport\n0:01:38  Walking into terminal building, heading for WOW Air Check in\n0:03:23  WOW Air Bag Drop\n0:06:38  Walking to security\n0:08:26  After security, walking to departure lounge\n0:10:23  Walking from departure lounge to D gates (non-Schengen)\n0:14:08  After passport check, walking to gate\n0:19:03  Our aircraft pulling on stand after previous flight, arriving from Berlin\n0:19:50  Cabin crew arrive at gate\n0:20:12  Boarding aircraft, taking our seat in seat 8F\n0:24:37  Cabin overview during boarding\n0:28:15  ATC: Route clearance to Gatwick\n0:32:58  Cabin view\n0:53:47  ATC: Pushback clearance, push and engine start\n0:57:43  Taxi clearance, taxi to runway 10\n1:06:34  ATC: Line up and wait clearance\n1:07:46  Take off clearance, take off from runway 10\n1:09:04  ATC: Contacting Keflavik Approach, cleared to FL290 with no speed restriction\n1:19:24  Cabin views\n1:21:00  Seat overview\n1:32:17  Using app 'Flight Info IFE' to check our route progress\n1:46:54  Meal service\n2:02:15  Cabin overview during meal service\n2:02:55  In seat power\n2:44:20  Checking flight progress with app 'Flight Nav'\n2:50:40  Cabin overview\n3:02:53  Cabin view\n3:04:48  In seat power - detailed view\n3:19:02  Cabin view\n3:25:32  Top of descent\n3:52:11  ATC: Contacting Gatwick Director who clear us to hold\n4:09:51  ATC: Contacting Gatwick Tower\n4:11:19  Breaking through cloud, cleared to land runway 26L\n4:12:14  Touchdown, taxi to South Terminal\n4:19:05  Going underneath bridge at Gatwick\n4:20:23  Pulling on stand\n4:23:22  Disembarking into south terminal\n4:32:40  Baggage claim\n4:34:11  Customs, exiting terminal to kerb\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"TKnAtD3xqe0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1497014192000)};

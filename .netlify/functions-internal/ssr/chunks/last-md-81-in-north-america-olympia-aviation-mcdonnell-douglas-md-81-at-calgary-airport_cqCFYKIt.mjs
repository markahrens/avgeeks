const data = {name:"LAST MD-81 IN NORTH AMERICA! Olympia Aviation McDonnell-Douglas MD-81 at Calgary Airport",description:"Last weekend, this rare McDonnell Douglas MD-81 paid a visit to Calgary International Airport, bringing the Detroit Red Wings to play against the Calgary Flames. This now 41-year-old MD-81 was first delivered to Swissair in 1981, and to the best of my knowledge, is now the very last MD-81 model that's flying in North America. \n\nIt's always a treat to see this plane during NHL season, and hopefully the Red Wings will keep it flying for many years to come.

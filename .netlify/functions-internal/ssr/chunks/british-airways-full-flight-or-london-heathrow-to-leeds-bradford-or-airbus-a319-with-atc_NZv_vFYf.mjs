Once through security we walk to our gate for today where our aircraft is waiting for us.  We are soon called for boarding and there is a moment of humor from the flight deck on ATC as they get confused with the callsign for today's flight, before we push back and start the engines.  From there it's a long taxi to runway 27L before we line up and depart during a beautiful sunset.  We make a right turn after take off, heading towards the East Midlands, and it is such a clear evening that even overhead Nottingham we can see The Wash and the Norfolk coast over 100 miles away to the east.  We soon commence our descent into Leeds and make a smooth approach to runway 32 where we touch down on schedule.  After the airbridge is connected we walk through the terminal to the street.\n\nAirline:  British Airways\nFlight:  BA1344\nAircraft:  Airbus A319 G-EUPC\nFrom:  London Heathrow (LHR)\nTo:  Leeds Bradford (LBA)\nDeparture:  18:23\nArrival:  18:57\nFlight Time:  0:34\nSeat:  7F \nFlight Path:  https://goo.gl/UEppfb\n\nKey moments in flight:\n\n0:00:03  Outside Heathrow Terminal 5, walking through to security\n0:03:03  After security, walking to gate\n0:10:46  Boarding the aircraft\n0:28:11  Push and start clearance from Heathrow Ground\n0:33:01  Taxi to runway 27L\n0:56:54  Line up runway 27L\n0:59:15  Take off runway 27L\n1:19:10  Top of descent\n1:24:01  Contacting Leeds Approach\n1:29:37  Established on ILS for runway 32, contacting Leeds Tower\n1:33:14  Landing on runway 32, taxi to terminal\n1:38:12  Disembarking via jetway, walking through terminal to landside\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"UCR2zthmJOY",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1483106429000)};

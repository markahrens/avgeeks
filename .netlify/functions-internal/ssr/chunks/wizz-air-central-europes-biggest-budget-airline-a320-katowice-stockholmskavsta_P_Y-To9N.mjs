I got a lot of comments saying ‚Äúwell what do you expect for a low cost carrier?‚Äù.\n\nThe truth is, in Europe, flying budget can actually be pretty good. This flight with Wizz Air delivered good value. It was punctual, simple, and pleasant. For ¬£43 I got everything included - that‚Äôs not a hand baggage only fare, that‚Äôs for a hold bag, Priority everything, front seats, and flexibility. The lot. I‚Äôm struggling to think of cheaper flights that would include all that in Europe. \n\nAnyway, Wizz Air are a somewhat unremarkable airline, but who cares when flying is this cheap? Sure, Skavsta is not that accessible to Stockholm, and the bus ride into town was nearly as long as the flight, but I enjoyed it all the same. In conclusion, Wizz get a big thumbs up. \n\nA lot of you ask to see more budget airlines. They‚Äôre coming! I‚Äôm booked on each of JetBlue, Spirit and Frontier on an upcoming USA trip this summer, and I‚Äôll be sampling a couple in Asia, too. I‚Äôm also taking Norwegian transatlantic in their 737MAX. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

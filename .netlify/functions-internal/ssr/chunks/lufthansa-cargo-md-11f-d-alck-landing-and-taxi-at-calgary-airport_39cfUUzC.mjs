const data = {name:"Lufthansa Cargo MD-11F [D-ALCK] Landing and Taxi at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Any day where an MD-11 comes to town is a good day! Here we have Lufthansa's second to newest MD-11 Freighter ferrying in from Chicago O'Hare to pick up some Porsches which were brought here by the AeroLogic 777F two weeks ago to bring back to Germany. The Calgary International Auto and Truck show took place recently, which may have been why they were here. Either way, still very cool to see, not to mention them driving it into the plane at the end of the video! ATC is included, with a nice welcome from Tower.

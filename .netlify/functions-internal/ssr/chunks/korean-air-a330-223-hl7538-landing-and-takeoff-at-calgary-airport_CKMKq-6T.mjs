const data = {name:"Korean Air A330-223 [HL7538] Landing and Takeoff at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Several months ago, it was announced that Korean Air would be flying four charter flights to Calgary International Airport from Seoul-Incheon and back. This is flight #2, landing on runway 17R and leaving 2 hours later on runway 35L, operated by HL7538, one of the airline's eight A330-200 aircraft (and their first dash 200, at that). As uninteresting as the A330-200 is, it's always nice to see a different airline at YYC! KE has operated charters to YYC before, sometimes with 777 and 747 aircraft, but they haven't done any in recent years, so it's good to see them back. ATC is included with captions, I hope you enjoy!\n\nThe next 2 flights will take place on August 3rd and 8th, for any fellow spotters hoping to capture this unique visitor.\n\nThanks for watching!

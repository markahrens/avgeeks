const data = {name:"Interview with SAM CHUI, the most followed aviation blogger",description:"I've been on YouTube for about six months now. Learning how to make a trip report has been trial and error for me. But I just got a crash course from the world's leading expert. Here's what happened:\n\nAs I was getting ready to board Emirates flight 184 from Brussels to Dubai to film a trip report about the new Emirates Business Class cabin, I noticed a familiar face: Sam Chui. Sam Chui had the same idea I did...Cover the new First Class and new Business Class cabins. By pure luck, we decided to fly on the same day.\n\nWith more than 90,000,000 views and well-over 350,000 subscribers, Sam Chui knows a thing or two about how to make a trip report here on YouTube. I was looking forward to spending some time with him and learn about his approach to making trip reports.\n\nAfter saying hello, Sam Chui and I decided to sit down for an interview. It was tough to find the time because he spent most of his time out of his seat, filming the flight! Join me as I learn more about how Sam Chui came to YouTube, what he's learned from the experience, how to make a trip report, and how it's helped him grow as a person. \n\nLeave a comment: Would you like to see more videos like this? \n\nSam's Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/N178UA\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/",source:"youtube",source_id:"6T3EJ_HfQI4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1517356997000)};

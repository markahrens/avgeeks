This has to be one of my favourite trips of 2016 - Oman has so many hidden gems and surprises, and Jabal Akhdar (or the Green Mountains) in the Al Hajar mountain range was certainly one which I wasn’t aware of before! \n\nWe start our journey at Oman international airport, collecting our 4x4 which would take us down to Nizwa. This is actually part 2 of my Oman adventure, with the first part filmed at the Shangri La Barr Al Jissah Resort along the coastline. After collecting our Landcruiser, we headed South towards Nizwa. At which point we had to leave the main motorway and take a separate route up into the Mountains. This route is only accessible by 4x4 and this is enforced by the police so no taking your Prius up there! After an hour or so of driving up a quite steep gradient we reached the Alila Jabal Akhdar. This hotel has recently won an award of being one of the top hotels in the world, no pun intended, and it’s easy to see why, considering it’s locating it was absolutely outstanding! I take you around my suite and view from veranda. After a sleep you rejoin me from the viewpoint at the hotel, overlooking the mountain range and my word, perhaps one of the best views of my life, it really has to be said. The view was stunning. \n\nLater that day we headed over to an abondoned mountain village to explore, and whilst some of it was clearly quite dangerous (some recent collapses of buildings were evident) we carefully made our way around to view part lower settlement. It was really interested to see how the people would have lived years ago and explore an area that few people will get to see. Especially as in a few years no doubt the village will be too dilapidated to see. \n\nAfter being wowed by some spectacular Omani history we headed back to the Alila Jabal Akhdar to catch the sunset, again one of the best i’ve ever seen! I’d highly recommend this trip to anyone wishing to experience a different yet luxurious holiday in a new destination which need to be placed firmly on your bucket list! \n\n----- Background music -----\nWith special thanks to Gil Couto for use some awesome arabic trap music Gillionaire - GXLDPYRMD$.

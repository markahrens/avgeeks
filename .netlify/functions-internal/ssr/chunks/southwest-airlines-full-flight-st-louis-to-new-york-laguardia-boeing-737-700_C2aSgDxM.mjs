We make our way to the gate and board our aircraft in typical Southwest fashion.  Once we're onboard we find a seat towards the rear and settle down for our flight.\n\nAfter a lengthy taxi we takeoff from St Louis and head east towards New York.  We're served drinks and snacks amid some wonderful service from the Southwest crew.  We commence our descent towards New York LaGuardia Airport in a beautiful sunset, emerging from the clouds at 1200ft for a great view of the New York suburbs and Manhattan in the distance, as we make a landing at LaGuardia Airport on schedule.  We disembark and walk through the terminal, emerging onto the taxi rank outside LaGuardia Airport.\n\n\nAirline: Southwest Airlines\nFlight: WN6590\nAircraft: Boeing 737-700 N7718B\nFrom: St. Louis (STL)\nTo: New York LaGuardia (LGA)\nDeparture: 17:30\nArrival: 20:21\nFlight Time: 1:51\nSeat: 19A\nFlight Path:\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:07 Inside terminal at St Louis, walking to gate\n0:06:33 At gate E38 waiting to board\n0:06:53 Boarding our aircraft and taking our seat\n0:17:59 Cabin view\n0:19:24 Cabin view\n0:28:48 Pushback, engine start\n0:35:07 Taxi to runway\n0:43:36 Takeoff\n0:58:41 Snack service\n1:01:20 Drinks orders taken\n1:04:44 Drinks served\n1:10:24 Drinks served\n1:11:46 Seat view\n1:50:42 Filming equipment overview\n2:18:14 Commencing approach into La Guardia\n2:26:27 Final approach and landing at La Guardia\n2:36:27 Disembarking aircraft and walking through terminal",source:"youtube",source_id:"Iz_tO_gddE8",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1536929994000)};

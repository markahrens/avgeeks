const data = {name:"Full Flight Experience - Columbus, OH (CMH) to Philadelphia (PHL)",description:"Thanks for watching this Full Flight Experience!  It’s been over a year since my last Miles by Foot walk in Denver, but it was time to take another one. After getting a good deal on some frequent flyer miles, I rolled the dice and decided to fly from Columbus, OH to Philadelphia, PA for a day-long walk in December.\n\nAfter a post-shift drive to Cincinnati and a visit with a college pal, I woke up dark and early to drive to Columbus, giving myself plenty of time to tour the airside and landside terminal.  An early morning takeoff in the rain gives way to a pleasant, albeit obscured sunrise as we make our approach into Philadelphia. \n\nThanks, David, for meeting up with me and sharing some time with me! I hope you enjoy this video, and stay tuned for my tour of PHL, coming soon!\n\n--------------------------------\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: Republic Airlines (American Eagle)\nFlight Number: AA4521\nDate of Flight: Tuesday, December 5th, 2017\n\nOrigin Airport: Port Columbus International Airport (KCMH/CMH)\nDestination Airport: Detroit Metropolitan Airport (KPHL/PHL)\n\nDeparting Gate: B20\nScheduled Departure: 06:15 EST\nActual Departure from Gate: 06:10 EST\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 28R / 06:08 EST\n\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 9R / 07:21 EST\nScheduled Arrival: 07:55 EST\nActual Arrival at Gate: 07:36 EST\nArriving Gate: C17\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAircraft Information\nType: Embraer 175\nRegistration: N133HQ \nAircraft Delivery: April 2008 (Expressjet in December 2011)\nEngines: 2x GE CF34\nSeat: 9F Assigned / 9A Actual\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\nCanon Vixia HFM30\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView\n\n--------------------------------\n\nMusic\nWhen Ya Gotta Go Ya Gotta Go – Gelka\nBossambique – Sven Van Hess\nSignals – Scann-Tec\n\nAircraft and flight information from Planespotters.net and flightaware.com\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

const data = {name:"The LAST Air Canada A319 - Frigid Departure from Calgary Airport",description:"The latest aircraft type to depart the Air Canada fleet is the Airbus A319. Fin 274, C-GBHM, flew the final revenue flight for the type with Air Canada on February 7th, 2021, from Phoenix to Calgary.\n\nThe following day, it ferried to Kansas City as seen here, making it the last of the mainline A319s. These were a mainstay of the domestic fleet since the late 90s, and they definitely had a good run. The Jetz A319s will be sticking around, but the plan for the Rouge ones is unclear.\n\nSo long, A319!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Airbus A319-114 (A319)\nFlight Number: AC2346\nLivery: Old (2005-2017)\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-5A5\nRegistration: C-GBHM \nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Kansas City (MCI)\nCallsign: AIR CANADA 2346\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: February 8, 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

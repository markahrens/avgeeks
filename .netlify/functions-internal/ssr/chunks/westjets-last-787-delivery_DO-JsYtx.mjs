const data = {name:"WestJet's LAST 787 Delivery?",description:"On September 2nd, WestJet took delivery of their seventh Boeing 787 Dreamliner, C-FAJA, and is their first Dreamliner delivery since June of 2020.\n\nHowever, in light of their announcement that they're refocusing on Western Canada, and \"pausing investment into incremental Dreamliners\", there's been a lot of talk that this 7th one may be the last 787 that they're taking. \n\nThe original order from 2017 was for 10 aircraft with options for 10 more, and for two years now the 787 fleet stayed at 6 aircraft while traffic recovered.\n\nInterestingly, if this one is the last, it's also out of sequence with the other six, since the newest one prior to this is tail 907, while this one is tail 910.\n\nTails 908 and 909 are built and painted in full WestJet livery, but it seems they were both sent to storage during the pause in 787 deliveries.\n\nI'm still hoping this doesn't a ctually end up being their last 787, but regardless of how things go, it's great to see another new widebody addition to the fleet. \n\nEnjoy this video of tail 910's first arrival in Canada on its delivery flight!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

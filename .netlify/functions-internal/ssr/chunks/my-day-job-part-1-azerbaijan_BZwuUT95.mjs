const data = {name:"My Day Job Part 1: Azerbaijan",description:"Whilst flight reviews are my hobby, they don't pay the bills.  My actual day job is helping to run the family travel business Bunnik Tours and it's that job that enables me to travel the world - filming flight reviews on the way. \n\nBunnik Tours runs small group tours ex Australia to Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. For full details see https://www.bunniktours.com.au/\n\nThis video covers the first few days of Bunnik Tours' Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia tour which I escorted in August 2022. \n\nOur tour starts in the Azerbaijan capital Baku - which offers a wonderful mix of old and new.  We also travel Shamakhi and into the Caucasus Mountains. Closer to Baku we explore the incredible Mud Volcanoes and marvel at the 15,000 year old rock carvings at Gobustan National Park. \n\nThis video, the first part of My Day Job series on Azerbaijan, gives you a glimpse of what I do when I'm not filming flight reviews.  I hope you like it.  Let me know if you would like to see more content like this on my channel. \n\nThanks for watching and, as always, happy travels!\n\nCheers\n\nDennis\n\n#azerbaijan #BunnikTours #baku",source:"youtube",source_id:"hXLxYjMbiBo",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1674982818000)};

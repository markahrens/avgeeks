Well, I recently flew in Air Baltic BUSINESS CLASS on one of Air Baltic's Boeing 737-500's (YL-BBD)! The Air Baltic Business Class flight was from Minsk (MSQ) to Riga (RIX).\n\nThis Air Baltic Business Class experience was exceptional. Watch this video to see what made the trip so special. And there was a lot! Not only was the aircraft great, but the food and the crew were spectacular!\n\nAlong the way, this flight report will include information about the Air Baltic Business Class seats, the Air Baltic Business Class inflight entertainment (or lack of it), the Air Baltic Business Class food, and the Air Baltic Business Class cabin crew from this Air Baltic Business class flight! You can even watch the Air Baltic Boeing 737 take-off and land!\n\nWhat do you think of Air Baltic Business Class?

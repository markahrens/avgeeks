const data = {name:"Volga-Dnepr Antonov An-124-100 [RA-82079] Landing and Taxi in Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"Well, this is a nice surprise! What better way to be welcomed home than with a visit from an Antonov? ;) This video features the aircraft landing, taxiing onto the apron, and a view of the aircraft on the apron. Originally this bird was supposed to arrive yesterday, but the flight got delayed. Not sure what it's doing here, but the most interesting part about this is where it came from - The NASA Shuttle Landing facility! I hope you all enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

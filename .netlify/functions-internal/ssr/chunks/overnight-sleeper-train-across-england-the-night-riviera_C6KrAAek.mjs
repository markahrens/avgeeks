This 9 hour trip will take us over 300 miles, overnight, to the most westerly point of the UK. Starting at London Victoria Station, we’ll take a look at the First Class lounge complete with food service and showers. Today I’ve booked a sleeper cabin, so I’ll be sharing exactly what this is like, the various facilities such as the bathroom, food service, onboard restaurant and other rooms available onboard.\n\nI aim to give you the experience of what it’s like to travel on this iconic sleeper service. Perhaps this is something you too would like to try out? Personally I find waking up gliding along the countryside is one of the most rewarding parts of trips like these. Plus the feeling of going to sleep and arriving somewhere many miles away from where your departure is a truly thrilling part of the adventure. \n\n0:00 - Introduction\n1:55 - Getting Onboard\n3:29 - The Restaurant \n4:44 - Bedroom Tour\n08:58 - Breakfast\n11:01 - Coach Tour\n11:41 - The Cost \n12:51 - Penzance Arrival",source:"youtube",source_id:"YsdEKAll1YM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1653847210000)};

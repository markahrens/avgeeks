Air Inuit is a small airline based in Quebec and, as the name implies, primarily flies within Northern Quebec as well as Nunavut  They're based in Montreal, and ironically, I was about to upload my video of this exact aircraft in Montreal when I got wind of its visit here. Never thought I would see this fantastic looking classic 737 here in Calgary! It was here for a university football charter.

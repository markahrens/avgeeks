const data = {name:"Delta One A330neo Seattle to JFK | The ULTIMATE Delta Air Lines Test",description:"In this video, join me for Delta One service from Seattle to JFK to decide for yourself whether Delta Air Lines deserves to be considered the top airline in the United States.\n\nYou’ll see everything: From the Delta Sky Club Lounge to the Delta One Seat on the A330neo. You’ll see how the premium Delta One meal service looks and get a sense for Delta Air Lines’ most advanced Inflight Entertainment. But, perhaps most importantly, I’ll share some insight into what Delta Airlines’ service is like.\n\nDelta has always been a top-of-the-mark airline among US Carriers thanks, in large part, to the fantastic crews onboard their airplanes. In this video, I’ll break that down for 2021.\n\nBut, perhaps best of all, I’ll rank it all in order to give you a “JebScore.”\n\nPlease note, none of my comments should be construed as anything other than an attempt to help you decided whether you want to spend your hard-earned money on this experience. I feel nothing but gratitude for every experience I have in the sky – especially in a lie flat seat like this one!\n\nBetween now and the next time, “see you in the sky!”\n\nStandard YouTube Description Language\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:29 Delta Sky Club Seattle\n2:56 Delta A330neo Arrival\n3:30 Why I haven’t been flying Delta\n4:50 Delta A330neo Seat Tour\n6:50 Delta A330neo Departing Seattle-Tacoma International Airport\n9:01 Delta One Meal Service\n10:35 Delta A330neo Cabin Tour\n11:47 JebScore\n\nAirports Revealed: Seattle-Tacoma International Airport \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LcPca89PEE&t=3s\n\nSeattle to Shanghai on the Inaugural A330neo Flight\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHt-JPNtpkA\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nPlus Width – Trailer Worx\nI See Blue – Dye O\nSalt – Dye O\nSail – Dye O\nAlone Again – Deskant\nMirage – Dye O",source:"youtube",source_id:"yl-izlsJfT4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1631458826000)};

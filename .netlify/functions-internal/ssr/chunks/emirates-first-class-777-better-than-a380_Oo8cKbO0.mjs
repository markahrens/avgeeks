The Emirates First Class product is the same in both its Boeing 777 and Airbus A380 aircraft - however I think the 777 First Class product is the better one - watch this video to find out why. \n\nReview covers First Class Lounge in Dubai, boarding, in-flight service, first class seat/suite, the seat in bed configuration and in-flight dining.   I hope you enjoy this video - check out my other flight reviews on DennisBunnik Travels.",source:"youtube",source_id:"hwHupTHbGVk",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1449114864000)};

I loved my flight to Orlando on Silver Airways this morning; it was novel, charming, and efficient. On my way back, I'm taking a more conventional route and airline aboard an American Airlines A321 to Charlotte.\n\nAs is often the case in Orlando, the weather was beautiful and warm, which led to a clear, albeit hazy trip across the southeastern United States. We'll be heading out in the late afternoon, keeping the setting sun to our west for a short, 70-minute flight.\n\nEven on a short, potentially familiar trip, we'll get to see a clear, uninterrupted view of the landscape, enjoy the roar of the engines, as well  as the crew's solid service. Our destination, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, is one of American Airlines' busiest hubs, and we'll hit the ground running to explore that airport before our final trip home.\n\nTake a flight with me, and enjoy the ride!\n\nVideo Timeline\n00:40 - Boarding\n01:10- Pushback\n01:50 - Taxi\n02:30 - Special Planespotting!\n03:20 - Takeoff\n04:40 - Snack Service and Seat Contents\n06:05 - Final Approach\n07:25 - Landing\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: American Airlines\nFlight Number: AA 677\nDate of Flight: Tuesday, September 10th, 2019\n\nOrigin Airport: Orlando International Airport (KMCO/MCO)\nDestination Airport: Charlotte Douglas International Airport (KCLT/CLT)\n\nDeparting Gate: 54\nBoarding Time: 4:43 PM EDT\nScheduled Departure: 5:01 PM EDT\nActual Departure from Gate: 4:55 PM EDT\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 36R / 5:08 PM EDT\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 36L / 6:21 EDT\nScheduled Arrival: 6:53 PM EDT\nActual Arrival at Gate: 6:50 PM EDT\nArriving Gate: D11\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\nCanon Vixia HFM30\nGoPro Hero 7 Black\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView\n\nAircraft and flight information from planespotters.net and flightaware.com.\n\nMap graphics and information from OpenStreetMap.com.

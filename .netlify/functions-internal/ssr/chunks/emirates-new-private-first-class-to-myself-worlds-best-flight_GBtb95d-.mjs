const data = {name:"EMIRATES NEW PRIVATE FIRST CLASS to MYSELF **World's Best Flight**",description:"I had the whole of Emirates First Class to myself on my recent flight from Dubai to London. Come and experience the best flight you can take!\n#emirates #firstclass #flightreview\n\nWhere do we start here! Called the \"Game Changer\" Emirates launched this to rival all luxurious flight products, both commercial and private. Flying only on their 777 and only on a handfull of routes I had the chance to fly this back home to London after my First Class trip around the world. \n\nThis review is probably one of my favourite just due to the scale of how incredible this flight was from start to finish. Not only did I get the private suite to myself I had three of them! One to sleep in, one to relax in and one to eat in! All suites are fully private with floor to ceiling windows. \n\nHow did I book this?\n\nI booked this in cash as part of a wider Emirates First Class intin, from Seoul to London. The actual cost of this specific flight is calculated at Â£1,000 significantly cheaper than the usual cost. My trick is to search for the routes which are least busy, and be flexible with your dates. I'm doing a full breakdown of this flight booking over on my IG instagram.com/will.luxurytravel \n\nThis honestly was the best First Class flight I have taken, and I would class it as one of the best First Class products out there. The only others which come close are Etihad's First Class Apartments and Air France's La Premiere but neither offer the privacy of Emirates new 777 First Class. \n\nThanks to the wonderful crew on my First Class flight to London.",source:"youtube",source_id:"rOaZBRExUP0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1588276301000)};

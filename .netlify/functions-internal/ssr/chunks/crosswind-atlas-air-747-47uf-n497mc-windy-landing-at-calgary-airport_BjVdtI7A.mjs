const data = {name:"CROSSWIND! Atlas Air 747-47UF [N497MC] Windy Landing at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"This was a fantastic sight! I've never managed to see a 747 land on Calgary's crosswind runway before, but thanks to another spell of Chinook winds, it was just windy enough for them to switch to crosswind operations long enough for this 747 to arrive! And what an arrival too, look at the nose down attitude on short final and that nose gear bounce/wing dip after touchdown! ATC is included, I hope you enjoy this windy arrival as much as I did watching it :)\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Atlas Air (GTI/5Y)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-400F (B744)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x GE CF6-80C2B5F \nRegistration: N497MC\nRoute: Mexico City (MEX) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Giant 8707 heavy\nRunway used: 29\nDate filmed: October 24, 2017\nLocal time: 1700\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N497MC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"f9wjLhv9afI",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1508904533000)};

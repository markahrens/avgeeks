const data = {name:"Calgary International Airport - The Best of 2022",description:"2022 was, thankfully, a much busier year at Calgary International Airport. With traffic rebounding nicely, especially during the summer, things looked far more normal.\n \nSo, like I did for 2021, I thought I would take today to look at some of the best visitors and some special moments for plane spotting at YYC this year.\n \nThis isn’t an exhaustive list by any stretch and I did miss out on a few things, but as far as videos that I filmed go, this is the best of Calgary International Airport in 2022!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

Just as I got into my seat, I saw that KLM 747 taxiing, so I immediately got out my camera and started filming. Sorry about the break in the video right after I zoom in on the \"Hobbit Jet\" parked at a remote stand. I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe!

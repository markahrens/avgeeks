Once on board, we push back from the gate and taxi out to runway 09 for a departure to the east.  With a low cloudbase we are in the cloud before we reach the other end of the runway, but soon emerge to a beautiful sunny day over Nottingham, the steam from Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station clearly visible above the cloud.  It remains fairly cloudy for much of the flight up the country, however we get a brief view of the ground over the Lake District, before we begin our descent into Glasgow.  The cloudbase is a little higher in Glasgow, and we emerge from the clouds getting a good view over the outskirts of the city before landing onto runway 23 and taxying into the terminal after a flight time of 52 minutes.\n\n***PLEASE SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, COMMENT, AND FOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, GOOGLE+ AND INSTAGRAM!!***\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

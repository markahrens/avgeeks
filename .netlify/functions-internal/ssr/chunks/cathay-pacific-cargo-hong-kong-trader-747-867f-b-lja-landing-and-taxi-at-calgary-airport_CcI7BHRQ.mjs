const data = {name:"Cathay Pacific Cargo \"Hong Kong Trader\" 747-867F [B-LJA] Landing and Taxi at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Just a week after I caught Cargolux's \"Cutaway\" livery, here's another one I've been trying to catch for ages! Cathay Pacific Cargo's Hong Kong Trader has been to YYC quite a few times, but this time I was lucky. Cathay is already tricky enough to see in daylight, but in a special livery is just icing on the cake! Here we have B-LJA, operating a very delayed \"Cathay 095 heavy\" landing on runway 35R this evening and taxiing to our cargo apron, and some views of it parked. ATC is included, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Cathay Pacific Cargo (CPA/CX)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-8F (B74N)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: \"Hong Kong Trader\"\nEngines: 4x GEnx-2B67\nRegistration: B-LJA\nRoute: New York (JFK) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Cathay 095 Delta heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: May 28, 2017\nLocal time: 1930\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/BLJA\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"c9YkjmQUR2g",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1496032689000)};

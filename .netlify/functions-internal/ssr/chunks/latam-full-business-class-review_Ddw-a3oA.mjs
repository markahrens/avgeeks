For this reason alone you can put LATAM on your list to fly. \n\nJoin me as I fly South America's largest airline LATAM from Sydney Australia to Auckland New Zealand in their premier business class.  This LATAM full business class flight review covers the entire process from the Qantas business class lounge in Sydney right through to disembarkation in Auckland. \n\nOn the way I'll try out the LATAM business class seat both in seat and bed mode, I'll taste the food, explore the entertainment system and experience the inflight service from the delightful LATAM cabin crew. \n\nHere's the link to that behind the scenes video on Air Cargo I filmed as part of my behind the scenes video series at Qatar Airways:  https://youtu.be/HWO9NM0py28 \n\nLATAM Business Class Flight Review\n\n#LATAM #flightreview #businessclass",source:"youtube",source_id:"HXHH1iCBSVk",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1692524914000)};

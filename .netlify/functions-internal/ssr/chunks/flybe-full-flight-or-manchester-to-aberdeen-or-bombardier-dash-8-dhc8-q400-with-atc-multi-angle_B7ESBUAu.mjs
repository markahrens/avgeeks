We enter the terminal and go through security, at a moderate pace as we're running a little late for today's flight.  Once through security our gate is immediately called and head for the Flybe gates to board our aircraft, Bombardier DHC8-Q400 G-JECJ, the second time I've flown on this aircraft (the last time was Glasgow to East Midlands).\n\nWe board the aircraft through the forward air stairs, pausing to give a demonstration of my gimbal to the flight attendant who is very interested in it :)  We take our seat in 7A, my favorite seat on the Q400.  Before long boarding is complete, we receive our taxi clearance and taxi out to runway 23L, following a Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 on it's second day of operation at Manchester.\n\nWe take off and are quickly above the fog in the sunshine, and there is a little confusion on ATC as there was a similar callsign on frequency.  We head north across the Lake District at 24,000ft, passing into Scotland near to Edinburgh.  The cloud below us clears to give us a fantastic view of the Cairngorms as we approach Aberdeen.  The snowy mountains make way for rolling hills as we descend towards Aberdeen, and we are vectored for the approach to runway 16 at Aberdeen.  We touch down ahead of schedule and taxi to the terminal, before disembarking through the forward steps and walking into the small terminal building.\n\n0:00:03  Outside Manchester Airport's Terminal 3, walking into terminal\n0:03:30  Going through security\n0:03:36  Walking to departure lounge\n0:05:30  Walking to gate\n0:08:21  At gate and boarding the aircraft\n0:15:10  Route clearance to Aberdeen from ATC\n0:22:07  First Officer Mike Aston welcomes us aboard\n0:26:06  Push and start clearance from ATC\n0:31:07  Taxi clearance from ATC\n0:34:56  Taxying alongside Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 to Houston\n0:42:10  Take off clearance from ATC\n1:21:50  Update on arrival from flight deck\n1:28:00  Cairngorm mountains\n1:35:47  Commencing approach to Aberdeen\n1:40:19  Final approach to runway 16\n1:43:12  Landing and taxi to terminal\n1:47:20  Disembarking through forward door\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"g9zQwEtkj6k",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1485525615000)};

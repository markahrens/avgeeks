We’ll see what’s happening at CVG Airport in this Airport Behind the Scenes video. CVG Airport may be called Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, but it’s actually located near Covington, Kentucky, which is why it’s called CVG Airport.\n\n0:00 Welcome and Introduction\n1:38 How Does Cincinnati's Airport’s Cargo Operation Work?\n3:08 CVG Airport’s Passenger History\n4:45 Interview with CVG Airport Operations Agent Chris Sundly\n6:37 Cincinnati Airport Runway Inspection\n7:54 CVG Airport’s Cargo Operation History and Future\n8:54 Inside the CVG Airport’s Passenger Terminal\n10:53 Even more to CVG Airport, Including CVG Planespotter’s Park!\n11:30 Conclusion\n11:46 Bloopers\n\nThis is the first video in a series I’m calling AirportsRevealed™ in which we go behind the scenes to explore airports around the world to discover what makes them unique. In this video we’ll explore the fascinating cargo operations here at CVG Airport and, during our CVG Airport Tour, we’ll even uncover the fascinating history of how CVG Airport became the Seventh Largest Cargo Airport in North America in 2019.\n\nWe’ll investigate the CVG Airport’s terminal and concourses and explore how these structures came to be. We’ll look through lounges (including one of the only remaining Delta Air Lines Crown Clubs), check out the restaurants, and the other amenities available to passengers at the CVG Airport.\n\nWe’ll get up close and personal with some of the massive, wide-body jets using CVG Airport’s Cargo Operations.

We’ll look through the more than 900 acres of CVG Airport land Amazon is developing to support a 3,000,000 square foot building for an operation that will involve more than 85 aircraft each day.\n\nWe’ll even get to know one of CVG’s Airport Operations Agents who will share what it’s like to work in one of the most fascinating jobs at CVG Airport!\n\nSpecial thanks to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International\nAirport and Chris Sundly for making this video possible!\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! http://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nHere are some other Behind the Scenes Videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFepRfjAwg9lwj1ZTB7OVIQhR\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: https://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMUSIC:\nMalleable (Sting) - Peter Sandberg\nCelebration of Life - Tomas Skyldeberg\nMalleable - Cody High\nWake Up Virginia - Plain Strolls\nWake Up Lucy - Tall Oak Town\nWaking Up The Street (Instrumental Version) - MNDLSS\nStill Exposure - Jay Varton\nThrough The Eye of the Needle - Josef Falkenskold\nThe Street Performer - The Fly Guy Five",source:"youtube",source_id:"_3EXK5e83Ns",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1604762102000)};

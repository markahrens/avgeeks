We board our aircraft today, Boeing 777-300ER A7-BAF wearing the OneWorld livery.\n\nBefore long we are pushing back from the gate to begin our flight across the Middle East to Egypt.  The GE90s roar into life and we taxi to the runway before departing to the north.  We head towards Dammam, Saudi Arabia, before turning left and heading across the Saudi Arabian desert towards the Red Sea.  We cross the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and then towards Cairo where we make a beautiful approach across the desert, getting a glimpse of the famous pyramids on approach to the airport.  We make a smooth touchdown before taxying in to the terminal.\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"OI9VUiw8u_Q",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1490363997000)};

In a competitive market they are carving out a niche and giving the big boys a run for their money. \n\nThis flight review is on a Boeing 737-800 flying from Nairobi to Kigali.  I flew Rwandair economy class but also had a good look at their business class cabin.  \n\nNext time your travelling to or through Africa give them a go!\n\nObviously I'd also recommend a few days in Rwanda - it's an amazing country.

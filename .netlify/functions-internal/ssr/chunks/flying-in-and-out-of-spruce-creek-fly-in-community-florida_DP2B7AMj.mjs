const data = {name:"Flying in and out of Spruce Creek Fly-In Community, Florida",description:"Spruce Creek is a fly-in community located in Daytona, Florida.  It is a residential airpark, where cars and trucks give way to planes, and you can taxi right up to your house.  Former residents include John Travolta, who owned a house here and kept his Boeing 707 and Gulfstream 2 here.\n  \nI was lucky to have the opportunity to fly in and out of Spruce Creek onboard a Grumman G44 Widgeon, an amazing experience.  We taxied right out of the garage of the aircraft's owner, and took off for a short flight before coming back and landing, taxying back to the house outside people's houses before parking right back up in the garage!\n\n********************************************************************\nPlease subscribe, comment and like, and follow me for regular full flight and behind the scenes videos!\n\nFacebook:  facebook.com/inflightvideo\nTwitter: twitter.com/inflightvideo\nG+: plus.google.com/+inflightvideo\nInstagram: instagram.com/inflightvideo\n********************************************************************\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

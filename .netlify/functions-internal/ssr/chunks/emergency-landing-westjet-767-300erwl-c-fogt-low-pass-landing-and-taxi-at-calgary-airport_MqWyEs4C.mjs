const data = {name:"Emergency Landing! WestJet 767-300ER(WL) [C-FOGT] Low Pass, Landing, and Taxi at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Today, WestJet 1860, a typical flight from Calgary to Honolulu had some issues with their landing gear after departure. They made a pass over the airport at 10,000 feet to try and determine the problem (not included in the video), then came back around to do a low approach on runway 29, when it became pretty clear that at some point during departure, the forward left main gear tire had come off the aircraft. The tire ended up landing within the airport boundary on the takeoff roll and was found embedded in a runway sign. The crew ended up circling for another 45 minutes before safely arriving on runway 17L with fire trucks in tow. It was eventually determined that the aircraft was safe to taxi to the gate. All of this is included in the video, with full ATC communications.

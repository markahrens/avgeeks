It is an overnight flight so was a perfect opportunity to test out the American Airlines business class lay flat bed.  \n\nThe American Airlines 777 business class flight review covers the Admirals Lounge at DFW, boarding, take off, the AA business class seat, inflight dining and entertainment.  I also cover the American Airlines business class amenities kit.\n\nFor more flight reviews including British Airways, Qatar, Qantas, Emirates, Cathay Pacific, Etihad, Turkish Airlines, LATAM and Baltic Air please check out my channel. \n\nFlight:     AA080\nRoute:    Dallas Fort Worth to London Heathrow\nWhen:    May 2017\nAircraft:  Boeing 777-300er   registration N734AR\nSeat:       12J\nCamera:  Sony FDR-AXP55",source:"youtube",source_id:"nM1-gfFeAgc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1497012074000)};

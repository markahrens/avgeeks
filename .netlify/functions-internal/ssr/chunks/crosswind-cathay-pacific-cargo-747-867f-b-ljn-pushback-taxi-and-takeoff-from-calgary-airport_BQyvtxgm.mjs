const data = {name:"Crosswind! Cathay Pacific Cargo 747-867F [B-LJN] Pushback, Taxi, and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Cathay Pacific Cargo serves Calgary two times a week with their 747-8 freighters, as a stop on their HKG-ANC-JFK-YYC-ANC-HKG route. Ordinarily, the flight arrives and departs in the middle of night, but sometimes it'll remain on the ground for up to 12 hours for crew rest, eventually leaving right in the evening. This is one such case, and thankfully it just so happened to be flown by the only 748 in Cathay's new livery. In addition to that, YYC had some fairly heavy winds at the time, forcing most arrivals and departures to utilize YYC's crosswind runway (a bit shorter than the others, at 8,000ft). A 747 departing off this runway is a rare sight, and this departure certainly did not disappoint! The video includes the pushback, initial taxi, and takeoff of Cathay Pacific's newest 747-8F, with ATC included. Sorry about the wind noise. Enjoy!\n\nTakeoff at 4:00 on the video.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Cathay Pacific Cargo (CPA/CX)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-8F (B74N)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New (2016)\nEngines: 4x GEnx-2B67\nRegistration: B-LJN\nRoute: YYC-ANC\nCallsign: Cathay 095 heavy\nRunway used: 29\nLocal Time: 1600\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/BLJN\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"dawplKH2cPQ",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1486998002000)};

const data = {name:"Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport - MSP - Terminal 1 Airport Tour",description:"Thanks for watching this brief tour of Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport!\n\nAs a lifelong traveler, I never get tired of the process of boarding a plane going somewhere new and exciting, and one of the little pleasures I enjoy is seeing a new airport on my way to my destination.\n\nMinneapolis Saint-Paul International Airport serves more passengers than every airport in each neighboring state, and it acts as a hub for Delta Air Lines and its regional affiliate Delta Connection for the Upper Midwest. MSP is a great airport to transit, spend some time in, or start your journey anew, with an interesting layout, lots of options for food and shopping, and good planespotting, too. This regional hub is home to its own airline, Sun Country Airlines, which offers dozens of seasonal destinations.\n\nThis tour focuses on the primary terminal of the airport, Terminal 1. This terminal contains seven concourses that serve Delta Air Lines and other airlines, including domestic and international carriers. The airport also features several areas throughout the airport where you can shop and relax. \n\nWhether you've got forty minutes or four hours, MSP has what you need to make your visit pleasant and memorable.\n\nAirports are our gateway to the world, and I hope you enjoy this and other airport tour videos from Miles by Foot!\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nGoPro Hero 7 Black\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView/Audacity\n\nMusic - Last Night Out by Colors of Illusion and For Another Day by Colors of Illusion\n\nAircraft and flight information from Planespotters.net, flightaware.com, and mspairport.com.\n\nMap graphics and information from OpenStreetMap.com.

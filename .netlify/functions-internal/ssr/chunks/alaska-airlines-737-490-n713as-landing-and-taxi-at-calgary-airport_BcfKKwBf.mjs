const data = {name:"Alaska Airlines 737-490 [N713AS] Landing and Taxi at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Alaska Airlines' 737s have been a welcome sight for the past few months. Unfortunately, the 737-400s of the fleet won't be visiting Calgary anymore, as the airline will be consolidating its 734 operations to Seattle-Alaska and inter-Alaskan flights, with a few exceptions in the continental US. If the 734 doesn't return, then this clip will be the second last arrival of an Alaska 734 into Calgary. ATC is included, hope you enjoy this classic 737!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Alaska Airlines (ASA/AS)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-400 (B734)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Old\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-3C1 \nRegistration: N713AS\nRoute: SEA-YYC\nCallsign: Alaska 597\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: March 29, 2017\nLocal time: 1300\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N713AS\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"EVwvtCEDmGM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1491711241000)};

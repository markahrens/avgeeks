Here we have their gorgeous Airbus A340, \"Pilatus\", making a smooth arrival on runway 17L at Calgary International Airport in some windy conditions! Edelweiss' Sunday flight has been moved to much later in the evening than their previous seasons, which is totally fine by me as it results in some gorgeous lighting!

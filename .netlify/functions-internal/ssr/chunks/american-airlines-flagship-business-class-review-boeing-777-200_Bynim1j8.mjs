This was my first time flying AA, and I was excited to try out their latest Business Class product. Aptly named Flagship Business, this also follow through to their First Class product - Flagship First. \n\nI paid cash for this ticket, and departing from Miami international airport. Today I’ll walk you through the seat, amenities, the food, bathroom and also give you my recommendation on whether to or not to fly American’s Business Class.

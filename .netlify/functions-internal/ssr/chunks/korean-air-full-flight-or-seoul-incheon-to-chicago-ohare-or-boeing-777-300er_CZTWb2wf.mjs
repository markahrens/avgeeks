After the huge GE90 engines spool into life, we taxi to the active runway, runway 33L.  We depart over the sea making a sweeping left turn back over the airport and across Korea.  We cross the Sea of Japan and enter Japanese airspace, crossing the coast north of Kanazawa.  We cross Japan towards Tokyo, crossing the coast to the Pacific Ocean to the north of Tokyo.  From there on it's a long flight across the Pacific Ocean as the sun sets, and then rises again a few hours later.\n\nWe make landfall into the United States overhead Seattle, crossing Washington towards Spokane.  We then cross Montana, South Dakota and Iowa as we head towards Chicago.  We commence our descent towards O'Hare overhead Wisconsin and make a right turn towards Chicago.  We fly overhead O'Hare airport, before making a sweeping left turn over Lake Michigan and commencing our approach to runway 28C.  We pass over the suburbs of Chicago before touching down smoothly on runway 28C and taxying into the terminal.\n\nAirline:  Korean Air \nFlight:  KE37\nAircraft:  Boeing 777-300ER HL-8008\nFrom:  Seoul-Incheon (ICN)\nTo:  Chicago O'Hare (ORD)\nDeparture:  11:06\nArrival:  09:41\nFlight Time:  12:34\nSeat:  40J \nFlight Path:  https://goo.gl/SD47p3\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"noWR_Su9z1k",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1482489899000)};

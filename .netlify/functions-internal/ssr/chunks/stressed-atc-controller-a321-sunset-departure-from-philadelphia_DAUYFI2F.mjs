A321 Sunset Departure from Philadelphia",description:"Departing Philadelphia as a massive storm front causes chaos for all the outgoing flights and a stressful evening for this air traffic controller trying to coordinate everybody!\n\nThe video begins at the gate in Philadelphia as we board our delayed flight, American Airlines flight AA735 to Las Vegas.  We soon pushback and make our way out to the runway, before the airport is placed on ground stop due to the approaching weather.  The air traffic controller then has to coordinate his departures, and loses his temper several times resulting in several pilots getting told off for not following instructions!\n\nOnce the storm passes over, we are treated to a beautiful sunset departure getting a fantastic view over Philadelphia and eastern PA.\n\nATC courtesy of LiveATC.net and video taken from seat 8F.",source:"youtube",source_id:"F8-0qpuJMCg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1464942600000)};

We enter the terminal and proceed to the WOW air check in area to drop our checked bag, before we head to Premium Security.  Once we have cleared security we proceed to the No. 1 Lounge, which is busy on this Saturday morning.  We enjoy a lovely breakfast with stunning views across the airport, before it is time to head to our gate.  We make our way through the busy terminal and it isn't long before the aircraft is ready to boarding, and we make our way to board this brand new Airbus A321.\n\nWe take our seat in seat 3A and the captain obtains our route clearance to Keflavik.  However at almost the same time another airline, British Airways, suffer a system wide computer failure which has a knock on effect as pushback tugs are stuck on BA aircraft.  We wait for almost an hour for a tug to become available, before finally a tug arrives and we are able to push back and get on our way.  We taxi out to runway 26L at Gatwick, before departing to the west and making a right turn towards London.  We get a great view of London below as we climb towards our cruising altitude of 36,000ft.  We head towards the northwest of Scotland talking to London and Scottish control on ATC, before beginning our Atlantic crossing.  We obtain our clearance from Shanwick to cross towards Iceland, and head out over the Atlantic.  We make a couple of radio check ins with Shanwick and Reykjavik control, before eventually we are handed to Reykjavik domestic control who clear us for our descent towards Keflavik.  We are initially cleared for an ILS approach to runway 19, however the captain requests an RNAV approach to runway 10 instead.  We are given our vectors for the approach before contacting Keflavik Approach, and finally Keflavik Tower as we commence our final approach.  \n\nWe break through the clouds just as we cross the coastline, and touch down smoothly on runway 10 before taxying into the terminal.  We disembark via the forward doors and walk through the terminal to baggage claim, emerging kerbside on a cold day in Keflavik.\n\nTIMELINE:\n\n0:00:04  Entering Gatwick Airport's South Terminal, walking to check in area\n0:02:55  Walking from check in to Premium security\n0:04:01  Walking from security to No.1 Lounge\n0:07:56  Walking around the No. 1 Lounge\n0:11:33  Walking from No. 1 Lounge to departure gate\n0:17:38  Boarding aircraft and taking seat in seat 3A\n0:28:45  ATC Departure Clearance from Gatwick Clearance Delivery\n0:32:57  Cabin view\n0:52:40  Cabin view\n1:26:56  Pushback and engine start\n1:30:04  Taxi to runway 26L\n1:47:51  Line up and wait runway 26L\n1:48:21  Take off clearance runway 26L, take off\n1:56:18  Flying over London with a great view\n2:06:43  Using the Flight Info IFE App to view our flight progress\n2:07:02  USB Power sockets\n2:09:32  Safety card\n2:11:30  Using the Flight Info IFE App\n2:24:44  Meal service (buy on board)\n2:29:29  Hot food - meal deal purchased (pizza, chocolate, Pepsi)\n2:38:46  Cabin overview\n2:41:48  WOW air's famous sick bags!\n2:50:16  Flight Info IFE App\n3:08:42  Cabin overview\n3:09:47  In flight magazine\n3:13:51  ATC: Position reports to Shanwick Oceanic\n3:28:24  ATC: Hand off from Shanwick to Reykjavik Control, contacting Reykjavik Control\n4:03:53  Top of descent, contacting Keflavik Approach\n4:19:13  Established on ILS for runway 10\n4:21:50  Cleared to land, crossing coast\n4:23:05  Touchdown on runway 10, taxi to terminal\n4:29:16  Disembarking through forward doors into terminal\n4:39:05  Baggage claim\n4:43:04  Walking from baggage claim to arrivals, exiting terminal to kerb\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"Gd3tbay1k8M",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1496494793000)};

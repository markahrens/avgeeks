const data = {name:"Kenn Borek Air Douglas DC-3 Turbine Landing at Calgary Airport",description:"Kenn Borek Air is a Calgary-based airline which operates a number of unique charter flights all over the globe, notably, to Antarctica during the southern summer. They operate several DC-3 Turbines, or Basler BT-67s, along with a large fleet of De Havilland Twin Otters. The Basler BT-67 is a converted Douglas DC-3 that's been lengthened and re-engined with Pratt and Whitney turboprops. As they say, the only replacement for a DC-3 is another DC-3! Here we have C-FMKB, a 76-year-old example arriving at Calgary Airport after a lengthy flight from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Just based on the past few flights it's been doing, I believe Buffalo Airways had leased this bird for a bit, but I can't be sure. Hope you enjoy this special bird, with ATC!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Kenn Borek Air (KBA/4K)\nAircraft: Basler BT-67/Douglas DC-3 Turbine\nFlight Number: 4K167\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard (red)\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-67R\nRegistration: C-FMKB\nRoute: Yellowknife (YZF) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: BOREK 167\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: June 16, 2018\nLocal time: 1200\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"h5b0ji8GVZM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1529449577000)};

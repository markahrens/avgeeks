const data = {name:"Icelandair \"Hekla Aurora\" Boeing 757-200 Landing and Takeoff at Edmonton Airport",description:"Ever since its introduction in 2014, Icelandair's brilliant \"Hekla Aurora\" special livery has eluded me, but finally, by a sheer stroke of luck, I happened to be in Edmonton when I got word that this bird was inbound! Sadly the runways weren't cooperative, and I ended up going to the wrong spot entirely for the arrival, so I've kept it pretty short. I think the departure makes up for it. Despite this not being my greatest video ever, I'm happy to have finally caught it! Hope to see it again sometime this summer, when the winds are a bit more cooperative. Hope you enjoy this long-awaited special catch!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Icelandair (ICE/FI)\nAircraft: Boeing 757-256 (B752)\nFlight Number: FI693/692\nAircraft Name: \"Hekla Aurora\" \nLivery: Aurora Borealis\nEngines: 2x RR RB211-535E4 \nRegistration: TF-FIU\nRoute: Reykjavik (KEF) - Edmonton (YEG) - Reykjavik (KEF)\nCallsign: Ice Air 693/692\nRunway used: 20/12\nDate filmed: April 20, 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dude8472productionsYT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"Bbng2ldOdmM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1524291421000)};

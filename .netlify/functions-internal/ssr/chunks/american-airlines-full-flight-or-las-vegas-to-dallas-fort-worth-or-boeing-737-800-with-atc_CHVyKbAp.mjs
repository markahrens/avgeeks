const data = {name:"American Airlines Full Flight | Las Vegas to Dallas Fort-Worth | Boeing 737-800 **with ATC**",description:"A full length full flight video in real time with American Airlines, from Las Vegas to Dallas Fort-Worth, onboard Boeing 737-800 N946AN operating flight AA70 on April 4 2016.\n\n**Every moment of the flight included from airport to airport. ATC for full flight.**\n\nOur journey begins in style as we take a limo from the Venetian hotel down the Las Vegas strip to Las Vegas' McCarran International airport.  Once we arrive we make our way through the terminal, which is pretty quiet for 8am on a Monday!  We board our flight and take our seat in seat 9A, part of American's 'Main Cabin Extra'.\n\nIt isn't long before we pushback and get our taxi clearance to runway 1R, getting an amazing view of the entire Las Vegas strip as we climb away to the north.  We then make a right turn and are treated to a great view of Lake Mead, and then the entire Grand Canyon unfolding beneath us.\n\nFrom there we continue in an easterly direction over Arizona and into New Mexico, with the desert unfolding beneath us.  We pass the town of Gallup, NM, and shortly afterward Albuquerque, NM.  We receive a small snack about halfway through the flight with coffee, before we enter Texas.  The ground gets less brown and more green as we head towards Wichita Falls, TX, and even greener as we start our descent towards the Dallas area.  We contact DFW approach, and are vectored towards the ILS for runway 18R, approaching over Lewisville, TX.  We touch down on schedule, and then have to hold for a short while for departing traffic before we can taxi to our gate.  We then get a gate change and are instructed to hold pending our new gate, and eventually make our way into the gate.\n\nWe disembark into the terminal, ready to connect for our next flight.\n\nKey moments in video:\n\n0:00:04  Limo ride down the Las Vegas Strip to McCarran Airport\n0:04:10  Arriving at McCarran Airport\n0:04:20  Entering the terminal, making our way to security\n0:07:03  Airside, walking to the shuttle transfer\n0:07:14  Shuttle train to D gates\n0:10:20  In D concourse, walking to gate D11\n0:13:30  Boarding at gate D11\n0:31:40  Pushback\n0:35:45  Taxi clearance to runway 1R\n0:43:15  Calling tower for clearance\n0:44:22  Lining up runway 1R\n0:44:58  Take off clearance\n0:45:03  Takeoff from runway 1R\n0:46:09  Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Venetian/Palazzo hotels\n0:46:34  North end of the strip, Trump and Stratosphere hotel\n0:48:30  Rainbow Gardens, NV\n0:49:30  Pabco Gypsum Plant\n0:50:45  Calville Bay Marina\n0:51:05  Lake Mead, NV\n0:57:05  Grand Canyon West Airport, AZ (GCW)\n0:57:40  Grand Canyon, AZ\n1:28:18  Gallup, NM\n1:40:25  Albuquerque, NM\n1:43:11  Snack service\n2:19:19  Red River, Childress, TX\n2:21:00  Top of descent, Foard County, TX\n2:21:48  Acme Gypsum Plant, Quanah, TX\n2:24:10  Vernon, TX\n2:30:11  Wichita Falls, TX \n2:32:11  Lake Arrowhead, TX\n2:36:20  Bowie, TX\n2:37:20  Contacting DFW Approach\n2:37:55  Sunset, TX\n2:44:12  Sanger, TX\n2:44:08  Denton, TX\n2:46:30  Turning to intercept the ILS\n2:46:42  Lewisville Lake, TX\n2:47:02  North Central Texas College\n2:47:29  Lewisville Lake Toll Bridge\n2:47:48  Hickory Creek and Lake Dallas\n2:47:52  I35 crossing Lewisville Lake\n2:48:59  Lewisville, TX\n2:50:42  Grapevine Mills Mall\n2:51:48  John W Carpenter Freeway (TX-114), Fort Worth, TX\n2:52:12  Touchdown on runway 18R\n\nVideo taken from seat 9A.\n\nAirline:  American Airlines\nFlight:  AA70\nAircraft:  Boeing 737-800 N946AN\nFrom:  Las Vegas (LAS)\nTo:  Dallas Ft Worth (DFW)\nDeparture:  09:56\nArrival:  14:02\nFlight Time:  02:06\nSeat:  9A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/xup0Ae\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

Air North Hawker Siddeley HS 748 in Action at Edmonton Airport",description:"Yesterday, this ex-Air North Hawker Siddeley HS 748 paid a visit to Edmonton, stopping in for fuel on its way from Whitehorse to Thunder Bay.\n\nAir North is the last operator of this British turboprop in Western Canada, and they've stayed primarily up in Yukon for the last few years, so this is a super rare sight to see it in Alberta!\n\nThey've been slowly phasing the aircraft out for a while now though, and this particular one is presumably headed to Wasaya Airways, another HS748 operator based out of Ontario.\n\nI have a particular affinity for British airliners, so when I saw this was coming to Edmonton, I had to go! Enjoy the sights and sounds of the HS 748 in action!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air North (4N/ANT)\nAircraft: Hawker Siddeley HS 748 (A748)\nFlight Number: 4N190\nLivery: Basic Air North w/o titles \nEngines: 2x Rolls-Royce RDa.7 Dart\nRegistration: C-GANA\nRoute: Whitehorse (YXY) - Edmonton (YEG) - Thunder Bay (YQT)\nCallsign: AIR NORTH 190\nRunway used: 02 / 02\nDate filmed: December 8th 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

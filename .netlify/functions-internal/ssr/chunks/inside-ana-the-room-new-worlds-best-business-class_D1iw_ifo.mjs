Sign up here: https://readly.me/trek_trendy , thanks to Readly for sponsoring this video. \n\nToday I'm flying from Tokyo's Haneda airport all the way over to Frankfurt, Germany onboard ANA's Boeing 777-300ER. This is quite a rare opportunity to try a product flown on just a handful of routes worldwide, made especially difficult by Japan’s boarder being closed for the last 18 months. \n\nAs usual I’ll give you a full walkthrough trip report of what it’s like to fly such unique premium products, today onboard All Nippon Airways' The Room. Experience the lounge facilities at Tokyo HND airport, onboard food, bedding and drink. What’s more I’m going to draw my conclusion on whether this is the world's best Business Class directly comparing this to Qatar QSuite, my previously announced winner of this accolade. \n\nFollow my travels live over on IG: will.luxurytravel \n\nThanks to my buddy James for the use of some of his footage from takeoff over Tokyo… go check his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqU2YGi4Jcdlx8sHsq0VRVQ",source:"youtube",source_id:"4mcCN8DsRJs",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1630276203000)};

Today seemed to be an exception, with the aircraft remaining on the ground for over 12 hours (apparently for crew rest) and leaving right around 4PM local time. Here we have, in my first video filmed in 2017, B-LJF taxiing and departing a very snowy Calgary International Airport, with ATC included.

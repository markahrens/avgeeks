const data = {name:"Buffalo Airways DC-3C [C-GWZS] Startup and Takeoff from Red Deer Regional ᴴᴰ",description:"Thanks to Mr. \"Buffalo Joe\" McBryan himself, who flew this bird back to Yellowknife and is seen in the video, for allowing me to get up close to this amazing aircraft! Buffalo Airways is an airline based in Canada's Northwest Territories, which operates a number of World War II era airplanes across the vast Canadian North, including this DC-3. If you've watched Ice Pilots NWT, you'll know the history behind WZS, their most famous DC-3. It was manufactured in 1942, and served the Royal Air Force as KG330. However, this particular bird's claim to fame is not just that it flew in World War II, but it also flew in D-Day. It was also the one Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden flew in an episode of Ice Pilots NWT! Once I heard that this bird was in Red Deer (a small city halfway between Edmonton and Calgary) for maintenance, I knew I had to see it on the move. Here we have it starting up and departing runway 35 at Red Deer Regional Airport back to Yellowknife. ATC is included, and I hope you enjoy what is now the oldest (moving) aircraft on my channel!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Buffalo Airways (BFL/J4)\nAircraft: Douglas DC-3C (converted C-47) \nAircraft Name: \"Ed Force Three\"\nLivery: Standard with commemorative sticker\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 Twin Wasp\nRegistration: C-GWZS\nRoute: YQF-YZF\nCallsign: Charlie Golf Whiskey Zulu Sierra\nRunway used: 35\nDate filmed: May 28, 2017\nLocal time: 1030\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2015\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"bSVFfI3gDHs",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1496194825000)};

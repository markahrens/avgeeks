This “new” service has some winners and losers compared to the previous regime, but fortunately this flight’s one of the ones which has seen a significant improvement! Previously, this 1130 departure would have been a brunch flight, attracting only a cold continental meat plate. Now, there is a full lunch, with three courses (including a very tasty starter!).\n\nOverall, this flight was a pleasant surprise, with significant improvements over what I was expecting. Full details of the new Club Europe service (and all the “winners and losers” is on FlyerTalk, here: http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/british-airways-executive-club/1831879-club-europe-catering-guide-2017-edition.html. \n\nOh, of course the video features all the usual highlights, including some fabulous views of the south coast of England during our descent into Gatwick (can you spot the British Airways i360 in Brighton?).\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDon’t forget to leave a comment and thumbs up!\n\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTHE OLD DREADED CLUB EUROPE COLD BRUNCH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pprMWJWaldM \n\n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek #malaga #spain #ba #a320 #businessclass\n\nMusic: Dyalla – fresh cut\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",source:"youtube",source_id:"2MoiuM3V_DE",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1491125218000)};

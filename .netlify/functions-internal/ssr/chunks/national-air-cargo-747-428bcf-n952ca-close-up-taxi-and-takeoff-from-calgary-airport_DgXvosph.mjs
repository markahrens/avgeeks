const data = {name:"National Air Cargo 747-428BCF [N952CA] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Every year, around September, an event is held south of Calgary, known as the Spruce Meadows Masters, a horse jumping show with professionals from all over the world. As a result, YYC spotters are treated to this gorgeous 747 carrying a number of these horses from Europe and back home again several days later. Here we have N952CA, a 24 year old Boeing 747-400 Converted Freighter taxiing up close and taking off on runway 35R for Liege. Fun fact: Ever since the new runway opened, I had never caught a 747 taxiing up close on Romeo before this. ATC is included with captions as usual and I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

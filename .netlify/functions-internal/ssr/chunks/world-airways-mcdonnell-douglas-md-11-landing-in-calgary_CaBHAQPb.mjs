const data = {name:"World Airways McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 Landing in Calgary",description:"MY 250TH VIDEO!\n\nCan you say \"Extremely freaking rare\"?\n\nI'm SOOO happy I caught this bird, which is one of the last passenger MD-11s in the world. It was -20°C outside, and my fingers were frozen, but hey, I caught an MD-11! :D  It's the first and probably the last time I'll ever see one of these, unless I make a trip to Amsterdam Schiphol before fall 2014, which has a 0.0001% chance of happening. :P\n\nI hope you enjoy :D\n\nThanks for watching!

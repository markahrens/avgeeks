const data = {name:"Air Transat New Livery Airbus A330-200 Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport",description:"In November 2017, Air Transat, Canada's third largest airline, unveiled a new livery to celebrate their 30th anniversary. Since the majority of Transat's flying is based out of Montreal and Toronto, the west hasn't seen much of it, but lately one of the new livery A330s has been doing some of the Alberta flying. Here we have C-GUBF, a former Emirates A330-200, taxiing up close on Bravo and taking off runway 17L for Vancouver! ATC is included, hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Transat (TSC/TS)\nAircraft: Airbus A330-243 (A332)\nFlight Number: TS951\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x RR Trent 772B-60 \nRegistration: C-GUBF\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Vancouver (YVR)\nCallsign: TRANSAT 951 heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: June 3, 2018\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"-K7trhrUpfY",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1532275200000)};

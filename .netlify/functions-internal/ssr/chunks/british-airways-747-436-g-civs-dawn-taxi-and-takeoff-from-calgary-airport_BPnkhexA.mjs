const data = {name:"British Airways 747-436 [G-CIVS] Dawn Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Easily another one of the best catches of 2017! This gorgeous British Airways 747-400 flew into YYC yesterday with some extra passengers on board due to some previously cancelled flights. The crew stayed overnight and departed this morning, ferrying back to London as \"Speedbird 9151\". This marks the first time in about a year that a passenger 747's been in Calgary. Our last one was a Lufthansa 744 medical diversion, and another British Airways 744 in the middle of the night, also medical. Although, this is the first time since 2014 we've had a 747 here for a reason other than a diversion. Either way, I'm super happy to have caught it. BA's livery looks absolutely stunning on this aircraft! Enjoy this crisp sunrise takeoff, with ATC! \n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: British Airways (BAW/BA)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-400 (B744)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x RR RB211-524H\nRegistration: G-CIVS\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - London-Heathrow (LHR)\nCallsign: Speedbird 9151 heavy\nRunway used: 35R \nDate filmed: September 15 2017\nLocal time: 0745\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/GCIVS\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"d2n-yRUeXmg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1505531820000)};

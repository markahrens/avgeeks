We enter the terminal to check in our bags, then head through security to the departure lounge.  Once our gate is called we head through to the gate where we are able to board today's ride - a Boeing 737-800.\n\nWe soon push back and taxi to runway 33, where we make a powerful departure to the north, before a right hand turn to take us south towards the south coast.  We get some fantastic views of the south coast and the Isle of Wight, the English Channel and then the north coast of France.  The flight remains clear for the most part, and we see the entire of France until we hit the Pyrenees where it starts clouding over below.  We commence our descent over Barcelona and make our way across the Mediterranean towards the island of Menorca.  We make our approach on a cloudy day, touching down and taxying into the terminal right on schedule.  We disembark into the terminal and pass through immigration before collecting our bags and making our way out to the bus stand.\n\nAirline: TUI Airways\nFlight: BY7578\nAircraft: Boeing 737-800 G-TAWF\nFrom: Birmingham (BHX)\nTo: Menorca (MAH)\nDeparture: 14:49\nArrival: 17:59\nFlight Time: 2:10\nSeat: 6F\n\nTIMELINE\n0:00:06 Outside terminal at Birmingham, walking into terminal\n0:00:55 Heading to security\n0:02:20 Walking from security point to departure lounge\n0:04:27 Walking to gate\n0:08:21 Boarding aircraft\n0:15:23 Cabin view\n1:01:01 Cabin view\n1:10:04 Snack service commences\n1:10:15 South coast of England, Isle of Wight\n1:18:54 Cabin view\n1:21:36 North coast of France\n1:29:58 Overview of seat area\n2:05:21 Cabin view\n2:12:20 Cabin view\n2:15:33 Cabin view\n2:51:27 Final approach to Menorca\n2:59:07 Disembarking aircraft, walking through terminal\n3:06:58 Exiting terminal to kerb\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"s96EIMb4duE",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1531486796000)};

const data = {name:"Air France 787-9 [F-HRBA] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Montréal-Trudeau ᴴᴰ",description:"The 787-9 Dreamliner is a fairly new addition to Air France's fleet, and here it is taxiing up close and departing runway 24L at Montréal-Trudeau International Airport, operating the second flight of three daily flights operated by Air France between Montréal and Paris. As you can see, when only one runway is used for departures, you get a significant backlog of aircraft, so as a result, this bird was waiting quite a while for takeoff.

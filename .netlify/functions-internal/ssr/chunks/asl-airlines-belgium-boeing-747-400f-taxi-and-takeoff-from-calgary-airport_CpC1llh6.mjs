This year's 747 was operated by ASL Airlines Belgium, carrying 55 show jumping horses from Europe, and here it is departing as an empty ferry flight to New York the day after! Here we have OE-IFB, one of 5 747s in ASL's fleet taxiing up close on Alpha and departing 35L on a crisp September morning, with ATC.

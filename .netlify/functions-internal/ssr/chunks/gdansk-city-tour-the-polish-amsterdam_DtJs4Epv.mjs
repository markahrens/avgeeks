A polish lesson... climbing to the top of Gdansk cathedral and checking out the big wheel in the centre of town. Some things that I was a little silly... jumping off the pier by the beach and cutting my leg.. and getting a tad burnt, but that's ok because i'm English. Hope you enjoy the video let me know what you think. I'd highly recommend this gorgeous city!\n\n--------- MUSIC --------- \n\nLonging by Joakim Karud https://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud",source:"youtube",source_id:"nP4J9Btpxx0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1477426189000)};

const data = {name:"Getting Around Houston Hobby Airport - HOU - Complete Airport Tour",description:"Thanks for joining me on this tour of Houston's William P. Hobby Airport! Today's tour covers Houston's original and smaller of its two airports, which still operates as a hub for Southwest Airlines.\n\nDespite the construction of Bush Intercontinental Airport in northern Houston, Houston Hobby remains a bustling hub, offering over 50 destinations and hundreds of daily flights to destinations around the country, as well as to Central America and the Caribbean. This compact airport has worked hard over the years to remain relevant, and this year, they've earned Skytrax's coveted 5-Star Rating, the first such rating earned by any airport in North America. With the right balance of stores, restaurants, short walking distances, and world-class customer service, Houston Hobby is a great place to start or conclude your journey!\n\n*NOTE* - The boutique airline JSX also uses Houston Hobby, but I didn't cover them, as they're not located in the main terminal. If you're flying JSX, head to their website to get more information regarding arrival, departure, and parking.\n\nI do a lot of original research while preparing these videos, so please leave a comment below if you have questions about the tour or navigating the airport, and I'll do my best to answer them! Or, share your own thoughts and experiences about HOU!\n\nFinally, let me know where you'd like to see next!

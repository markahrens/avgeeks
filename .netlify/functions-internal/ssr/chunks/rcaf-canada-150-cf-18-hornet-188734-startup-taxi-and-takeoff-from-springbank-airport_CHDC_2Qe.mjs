const data = {name:"RCAF Canada 150 CF-18 Hornet [188734] Startup, Taxi, and Takeoff from Springbank Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Every year, the Royal Canadian Air Force paints a CF-18 Hornet for demonstrations at airshows. For Canada's 150th anniversary, they painted this aircraft in what I think is an absolutely perfect livery to commemorate the occasion. Flown by Captain Matthew Kutryk, callsign \"Glib\", this bird performed this past weekend at the Wings Over Springbank airshow, leaving this morning for what I believe is their next show in Quesnel, British Columbia. This video includes the Canada 150 Hornet starting up, taxiing, and blasting out of Calgary-Springbank Airport, a small airport 10 kilometers west of the city that usually only sees Cessna 172s and the occasional business jet. Enjoy this gorgeous livery departing, with ATC included!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF)\nAircraft: CF-18 Hornet (F18)\nLivery: Canada 150 Demonstration Livery\nAircraft Name: Canada 150 Demonstration Jet\nEngines: 2× General Electric F404-GE-400\nRegistration: 188734\nRoute: Calgary-Springbank (YBW) - Quesnel (YQZ)\nCallsign: Hornet 01\nRunway used: 17\nDate filmed: August 2, 2017\nLocal time: 1200\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"Ent9aYAaf5k",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1501732929000)};

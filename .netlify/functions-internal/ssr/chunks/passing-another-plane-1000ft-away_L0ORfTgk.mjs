The other aircraft is a United Airlines Boeing 777-200 (N793UA) operating UA508 Los Angeles to Washington Dulles at FL370, we are are onboard an American Airlines Airbus A321 Transcontinental (N103NN) operating AA171 at FL380.  I've seen lots of aircraft pass us but this was one of the closer passes I've ever witnessed, still perfectly safe with vertical seperation.\n\nPlanefinder screenshots:  http://imgur.com/a/JJiJZ\n\n**TO VIEW THIS FLIGHT IN FULL, PLEASE SEE https://youtu.be/fvh3dnyLKS4 **\n***PLEASE SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, COMMENT, AND FOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, GOOGLE+ AND INSTAGRAM!!***\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

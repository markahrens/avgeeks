I'm hoping this is the best BA 787 First Class 787 trip report out there! Join me on this fantastic 11-hour trip between London Heathrow and San Jose, California. We travel right into the heart of Silicon Valley, the USA's tech and innovation hub, on board British Airways' latest aircraft. \n\nThis video shows you all of the ground services, including BA's Concorde Room at LHR T5. It'll show you boarding, taxi, takeoff, cruise and landing. You'll also get to see not one, not two, but THREE full meals, one of which was taken inside the Concorde Room's private dining suites. \n\nI really hope you enjoy the video. Please share it, leave me a comment, and most of all - SUBSCRIBE! At least *30* more trip reports of various flavours to come this year, including the return trip from LAX on the A380 in First.\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips https://twitter.com/pauls_trips \n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"4LRFyTtxlRg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1472467760000)};

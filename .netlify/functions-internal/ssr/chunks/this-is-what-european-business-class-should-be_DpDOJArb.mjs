We'll check out the lounges, the cabin, the food, and the views from one of their 737s.\n\nI had been in Brussels following my incredible flight to and from Dubai with Emirates in their new 777 and needed a new way to get back across the Atlantic. Royal Air Maroc (RAM) seemed like a great way to do it. So I booked a flight from Brussels to Casablanca and on to Washington's Dulles International Airport. The schedule required a 20 hour layover in Casablanca, which I took advantage of by sleeping and checking out a little of the city. \n\nTake a look at this report about the first leg (BRU - CMN) and let me know what you think!\n\n(The next leg will be posted next week!)\n\nHere's a link to my review of Emirates' NEW FIRST CLASS cabin:\nhttps://youtu.be/AsswlMIo4vY\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic: \nEast West Dance Off - Aldous Young",source:"youtube",source_id:"wao8p9U4SjU",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1519988067000)};

We enter the terminal and make our way to security, eventually walking through to gate 12A where our aircraft is waiting to take us to HEL!\n\nWe are joined by a couple of other avgeeks who have travelled to Copenhagen to take today's flight, the last ever flight 666 to HEL on Friday 13th!  We are soon called for boarding, and take our seat in 6A.\n\nWe depart Copenhagen's runway 22R on a beautiful clear sunny autumn day, getting a great view of the Ã˜resund Bridge as we climb out.  We fly over Sweden climbing to FL370, and then cross the Baltic Sea before beginning our descent into Helsinki's Vantaa airport.  We get some great views of the beatiful Finnish countryside, before touching down smoothly on time in HEL!  We taxi into the gate, and disembark into the terminal making our way to passport control ahead of our next flight.\n\n0:00:07 Outside the terminal at Copenhagen, walking into Terminal 3\n0:03:18 After security, walking to gate\n0:11:03 At gate A12 waiting to board\n0:18:11 Boarding and taking our seat in row 6\n0:41:00 Pushback, engine start\n0:44:31 Taxi to runway 22R\n0:49:13 Cleared for takeoff\n0:50:33 Takeoff from runway 22R\n0:54:55 Copenhagen Airport\n0:56:42 Airshow map\n0:59:27 Airshow map\n1:02:20 Cabin view\n1:10:08 Drinks service\n1:22:51 Crossing traffic below\n1:27:58 Cabin view\n1:28:16 Passing traffic\n1:40:50 Connecting flight information on screen\n1:44:56 Contacting Helsinki Radar\n2:06:57 Final approach runway 04L\n2:10:43 Landing runway 04L\n2:18:41 Disembarking, walking to passport control\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"X0yGrtoUGMc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1508504398000)};

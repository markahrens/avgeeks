This aircraft links Miami and Los Angeles to provide aircraft positioning between Buenos Aires and Sydney international trips. The good news is, you can buy a ticket for the 5-hour hop for much, much less than a full international ticket!\n\nAlthough the flight was taken during poor weather, obscuring the ground, my video contains all aspects of service. The Admirals' Club at Miami, boarding, the seat, all the food and drink, the entertainment... Need I say more?\n\nLeave me a comment if you liked the video! And I'd be honoured if you subscribed to my channel. There are LOTS more videos like this to be posted in the coming weeks!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\n\nSnapChat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"LAznn23zPKw",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1471738775000)};

const data = {name:"A Tribute to Cathay Pacific Cargo in Calgary | Aviation Music Video",description:"Cathay Pacific Cargo served Calgary for 3 and a half years, from October 2014 to March 2018. As one of YYC's few 747 operators, every daylight visit was met by spotters and aviation enthusiasts alike hoping to see the Queen of the Skies in all her glory, myself included. Sadly, because demand for dedicated freighter service to Asia has decreased all across the board recently, not just in Calgary, Cathay Pacific Cargo has decided to terminate their Calgary service. Cargolux will continue to serve YYC with their 747-400 and 747-8 freighters, along with the occasional charter from Atlas and Korean, but it's a loss to see one of the 747s that I spent so many Saturday mornings out at the airport for, disappearing from Calgary skies. With the end of Cathay's service to YYC just a few days ago, I've made this tribute video, encompassing just a few of the many times I saw Cathay's Queen of the Skies here in Calgary. \n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dude8472productionsYT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nMusic is \"Milky Way\" by Whitesand (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe96JG5gdgSRtmqStx0isXA)\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"YwewUKoZPWA",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1522089890000)};

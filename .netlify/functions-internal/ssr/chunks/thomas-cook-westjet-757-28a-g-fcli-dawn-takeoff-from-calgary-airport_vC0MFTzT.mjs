const data = {name:"Thomas Cook (WestJet) 757-28A [G-FCLI] Dawn Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Finally decided to wake up at 6AM to catch this thing! Here we have G-FCLI, one of Thomas Cook's 2 757s leased to WestJet for the purpose of operating Calgary/Edmonton-Hawaii flights departing YYC on April 11th. These birds will be replaced by WestJet's 767s when they come in July. The video features part of the pushback, the taxi, and the takeoff with ATC throughout. There's some beautiful dawn lighting, as you'll see, along with a great RB211 spool up sound. Without further ado, I hope you enjoy my very first (and probably the only, since I am NOT a morning person lol) shot of Thomas Cook's 757.\n\nThanks for watching!

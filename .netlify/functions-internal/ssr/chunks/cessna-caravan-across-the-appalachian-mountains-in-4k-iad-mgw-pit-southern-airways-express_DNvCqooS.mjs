I love the personal, small-scale experience when flying EAS airlines, and I love to see how smaller communities connect to large airports, so I knew I had to give Southern Airways Express a try!\n\nAfter a mad dash across two Metro lines and a connector bus, I barely made my connection at Dulles. The day I flew was the first day Southern had moved its service from Baltimore to Dulles, and I wanted to make sure I was on it. This afternoon flight connects Southern with Pittsburgh with a short, intermediate stop in Morgantown over some beautiful mountain country in western Maryland and West Virginia. Check out the rivers, lakes, and valleys that pass beneath us as we travel!\n\nThanks for flying with me, and enjoy the ride!\n\nVideo Timeline\n\n#aviation #travel #southernairwaysexpress #iad #dulles #airport #flight #flightexperience #flightreport #flightreview\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFlight Information\n\nAirline: Southern Airways Express\n\nFlight Number: 9X 182/9X 111\n\nDate of Flight: Monday, June 28th, 2021\n\nOrigin Airport: Washington Dulles International Airport (KIAD/IAD)\n\nIntermediate Airport: Morgantown Municipal Airport (KMGW/MGW)\n\nDestination Airport: Pittsburgh International Airport (KPIT/PIT)\n\nDeparting Gate: H17\n\nBoarding Time: 17:32 EDT\n\nScheduled Departure: 17:15 EDT\n\nActual Departure from Gate: 17:37 EDT\n\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 30 / 17:42 EDT\n\nIntermediate Runway: RWY 18 / 18:31 EDT / 19:07 EDT\n\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 28L / 19:34 EDT\n\nScheduled Arrival: 19:40 EDT\n\nActual Arrival at Gate: 19:39 EDT\n\nArriving Gate: B41\n\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n\nAircraft Information\n\nType: Cessna 208 Caravan\n\nRegistration: N932SP/N1154F\n\nAircraft Built: November 2014/July 2004\n\nEngines: P&W CANADA PT6A-140/P&W PT6A SER\n\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n\nGear\n\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\n\nGoPro Hero 7 Black and Suction Mount\n\nFeiyuTech G6 Gimbal\n\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView/ClipStudio\n\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:10 - Boarding Process\n01:02 - Safety Briefing and Pre-Departure\n01:38 - Taxiing at IAD\n02:33 - Takeoff at IAD\n03:47 - Inside the Cessna Caravan\n05:00 - IAD - MGW Timelapse\n06:10 - Approach into MGW and Landing\n08:18 - Deplaning at MGW\n09:18 - Enplaning at MGW\n10:30 - Taxiing and Fast Facts at MGW\n11:15 - Takeoff at MGW\n12:20 - MGW - PIT Timelapse\n13:10 - Approach and Landing at PIT\n14:55 - Closing Thoughts\n16:07 - End Screen\n\n\nAircraft and flight information from planespotters.net and flightaware.com.\n\nArt and Icons by Beth McLain\nIG: bethmclain.art\n\nMap graphics and information from OpenStreetMap.com.

const data = {name:"FIRST FLIGHT! WestJet Cargo 737-800(BCF) Takeoff from Calgary Airport (4K)",description:"On April 3rd, one of WestJet's 737 Freighters flew for the very first time under a WestJet callsign, on a ferry flight over to Toronto.\n\nThree of these WestJet Cargo 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighters have been sitting in Calgary after being delivered almost a year ago. Unfortunately for them, they ran into some red tape with Transport Canada, and only officially received certification at the end of March. \n\nAs reported by Freight Waves in November last year (https://www.freightwaves.com/news/boeing-certification-troubles-in-canada-ground-1st-westjet-freighters), because of the fraught relationship between Boeing and the FAA, and subsequently, Transport Canada, Boeing's conversion process has been scrutinized heavily. As a result, WestJet's cargo plans have been delayed by over 9 months at this point. \n\nFortunately, that all seems to be resolved now, and the first revenue cargo flights for these planes are scheduled to start later this month. Good to finally see one of these on the move! Enjoy the video! \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

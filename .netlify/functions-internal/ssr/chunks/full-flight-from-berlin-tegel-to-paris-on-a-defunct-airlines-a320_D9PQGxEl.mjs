const data = {name:"Full Flight from Berlin Tegel to Paris on a Defunct Airline's A320",description:"Thanks for watching this Full Flight Experience!  For our ninth anniversary, my wife Beth and I decided to use some Delta miles and head over to Europe for a three-country tour. Our trip in November 2018 is one we'll never forgot; we still talk about it every day and reminisce fondly of the beautiful places we visited, the wonderful people we met, and the time we spent together.\n\nWe spent four days in Berlin, took a train to Prague and spent four more days in the Czech Republic. The last stop on our trip was Venice for three last days in Europe before heading home to the U.S. \n\nDeparting from Berlin's iconic, and soon-to-be closed Tegel Airport, we take a quick morning hop to Paris to catch our connecting flight back to the United States aboard Air France's subsidiary, Joon. Founded in 2017, the airline dissolved in mid-2019, only a few months after we flew aboard their service. Joon provided basic, no-frills service between European cities and leisure destinations. \n\nCatch the sunrise in this video as we soar west over Belgium, then follow our snowy descent into Charles de Gaulle Airport northeast of Paris. Although we're leaving our destination behind, we still have fun flying!\n\nAs a member of the YouTube travel community managing my travel during the pandemic, it's likely I will share a couple older, but new-to-you travel videos over the next couple months as an optimistic reminder of how travel might return in the near future. Thanks for bearing with all of us as we adapt to a world where travel has become more challenging!\n\n#flight #flightreport #flightreview #airfrance #berlin #paris #tegel #txl #cdg \n\nVideo Timeline\n00:15 - Tegel Airport\n00:45 - Pushback\n03:00 - Takeoff\n04:20 - Sunrise\n05:50 - Final Approach\n07:00 - Landing \n08:00 - Taxi to Gate\n09:30 - Gate Arrival\n--------------------------------\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: Joon\nFlight Number: JN 1135\nDate of Flight: Tuesday, November 20th, 2018\n\nOrigin Airport: Berlin Tegel Airport (EDDT/TXL)\nDestination Airport: Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (LFPG/CDG)\n\nBoarding Time: 06:08 CEST\nScheduled Departure: 06:35 CEST\nActual Departure from Gate: 06:28 CEST\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 08R / 06:36 CEST\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 09L / 08:01 CEST\nScheduled Arrival: 08:25 CEST\nActual Arrival at Gate: 08:12 CEST\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAircraft Information\nType: A320\nSeat: 23E & 23F\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\nCanon Vixia HFM30\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView\n\nAircraft, airline, and flight information from airfleets.net and flightaware.com, and wikipedia.com.\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

const data = {name:"RARE DC-8 STILL FLYING! NASA's Douglas DC-8-72 at Paine Field (KPAE) [4K]",description:"Over the past few days, Boeing and NASA have embarked on a new flight test project, using a 737 MAX 10 and NASA’s Douglas DC-8-72. These two planes are basing out of Paine Field in Washington State, and are doing some emissions testing for sustainable aviation fuels. \n\nThis MAX 10 is flying with both conventional and sustainable fuel, while the DC-8, which is NASA's Airborne Science Laboratory, follows the MAX in flight and measures the emissions from each type of fuel.\n\nThe MAX 10 in question is destined for United, and is one of Boeing's ecoDemonstrator \"Explorer\" aircraft.\n\nNASA’s Douglas DC-8, meanwhile, is one of very few DC-8s still flying in the world. It was first delivered to Alitalia in 1969, making it 54 years old! With less than 10 or so actively flying, this plane is truly one of the last of its kind. Plus, NASA will be replacing it with a 777 sometime in the next few years.\n\nAs you can imagine, all of this made for quite an opportunity to catch an extremely rare type actually flying, so @BSiskaAviation and I kinda had to make a trip down from Canada just to see it! I never thought I'd film a DC-8 in this day and age, so I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nSOURCES: https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2023-10-12-Boeing,-NASA,-United-Airlines-To-Test-SAF-Benefits-with-Air-to-Air-Flights\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

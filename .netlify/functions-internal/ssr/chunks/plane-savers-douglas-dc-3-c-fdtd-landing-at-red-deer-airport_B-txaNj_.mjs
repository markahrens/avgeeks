const data = {name:"PLANE SAVERS DOUGLAS DC-3! C-FDTD Landing at Red Deer Airport",description:"In December last year, Mikey McBryan of Buffalo Airways launched a new YouTube series called “Plane Savers”, in which he and a dedicated group of people were tasked with restoring an abandoned Douglas DC-3 that flew in D-Day. C-FDTD flew with the Royal Canadian Air Force in the Second World War, then flew with Trans-Canada Air Lines and Transport Canada before being donated to Fondation Aérovision Québec.\n\nFollowing that, it sat for about 27 years, until it was sold on eBay to Mikey himself.\n\n6 months of work later, C-FDTD, the “Plane Savers” Douglas DC-3, has finally made it to Buffalo’s maintenance base in Red Deer, Alberta! The aircraft flew in Sunday morning from Regina, Saskatchewan, on its way west from Oshkosh.\n\nI’m so happy I got to see this famous airplane flying! Enjoy this video of DTD’s windy arrival in Red Deer, as well as a look around the aircraft and a short interview with Mikey. Big thank you to him! Hope you enjoy the video.\n\nAnother special thank you to Brandon Siska for the thumbnail image.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nPLANE SAVERS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/mikeymcbryan\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nOwner: Mikey McBryan\nAircraft: Douglas DC-3C (DC3C)\nLivery: Custom 75th Anniversary of D-Day\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 Twin Wasp\nRegistration: C-FDTD \nRoute: Oshkosh (OSH) - Regina (YQR) - Red Deer (YQF)\nCallsign: Charlie Foxtrot Delta Tango Delta\nRunway used: 35\nDate filmed: July 28, 2019\nLocal time: 1200\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",source:"youtube",source_id:"g-18hYFcV4k",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1564405211000)};

Sorry for the lousy filming, I had my tripod tension settings wrong. \n\nSo, I've made a decision regarding my new camera. I'm returning it. It's like some of you said in my last video, there was no real difference in quality, and my current one does the job just fine. So... Yeah. :P I have 1 or 2 more videos that I shot with it, and I'll upload those soon.\n\nThanks for watching!

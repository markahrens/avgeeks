Here they are departing Calgary's second airport, Springbank, for their next show, which I believe was in Quesnel, British Columbia. Enjoy this comprehensive video of all 8 aircraft starting up, taxiing, and departing!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"--pNcv_m55k",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1504917188000)};

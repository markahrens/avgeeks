Once boarding is complete we push back and make the short taxi to runway 29.  We depart on a turbulent and gusty morning, and before we've even crossed the end of the runway we have commenced a left turn to take us over Neusiedler See.  From there we cross into Western Hungary and climb to our cruising altitude of 35.000ft.  \n\nOnce we're cruising above the clouds we fly through Serbia and FYR Macedonia, before crossing into Greek airspace where the cloud clears over the Aegean Sea.  We get a great view of the Greek islands such as Kos and Rhodes, and fly over a clear Mediterranean Sea towards the Egyptian Coast.\n\nBefore long the Egyptian coast comes into view and we cross the coast to the east of Alexandria.  We descend over the Nile Delta towards a dusty Cairo, before making a stunning approach over the Nile and the city of Cairo, as well as Almaza Air Base, making a smooth landing on runway 05C.  We exit the runway as Austrian's trademark classical music starts playing, and we make a lengthy taxi into Cairo's Terminal 3.\n\nOnce we disembark, we walk through Cairo's International Airport where we have to negotiate a connection from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 to connect onto Qatar Airways.  This is an interesting connection due to the lack of formal connections between the terminal.  It involves a lot of waiting around, and an immigration guy to drive us airside across the apron to Terminal 2 in a van!  We finally get our passport back with around an hour to go until the next flight and are able to proceed to the Qatar Airways lounge.\n\n0:34:43 Pushback and engine start\n0:39:00 Taxi to runway 29\n0:42:30 Line up runway 29, take off and left turn\n0:49:39 Neusiedler See, Austria\n1:23:00 Belgrade, Serbia\n1:30:03 Kragujevac, Serbia\n2:21:30 Islands of Chios and Psara, Aegean Sea\n3:29:11 Egyptian coastline, top of descent\n3:48:00 Giza, turning final approach\n3:49:11 River Nile\n3:53:00 El-Nasr Road\n3:53:22 Almaza Air Base\n3:54:28 Touchdown on runway 05C, taxi to Terminal 3\n4:06:33 Disembarking into the terminal, connecting from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"CgvBkoWIsJM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1491569996000)};

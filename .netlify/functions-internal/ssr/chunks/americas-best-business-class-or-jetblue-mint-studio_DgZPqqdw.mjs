This is one of the world's newest business class products and is flown on jetBlue's newest routes across the pond to London Gatwick and London Heathrow. I'll give you my brutally honest review of the studio and also the suites - yes there are two different business class products on the same plane. \n\nAs always in my trip reports, i'll be looking at the food service, what the bed is like, the lounge offering and overall experience for the money. Should you fly this? Well let's head over to LAX and find out together. \n\nFor background jetBlue name their Business Class MINT... I know, different right! And in my opinion demonstrate how the US should do Business Class... or what many domestic carriers like to refer to.. as First Class...",source:"youtube",source_id:"6sA6hxi0QYo",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1639178068000)};

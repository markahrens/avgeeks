const data = {name:"POOR: Don't Bother With TURKISH Business Class",description:"The first 1,000 people to use this link will get a 1 month free trial of Skillshare: https://skl.sh/trektrendy11211\nToday I’m flying Turkish Airlines Business Class on their newest Boeing 787 Business Class product all the way from Vancouver, Canada over to Istanbul Turkey. And boy do I have a trip report in for you today. I experienced the worst ever service interaction onboard; where I was shouted at, and left feeling very uncomfortable. What’s more boarding was a shambles, seating onboard was totally changed last minute and I almost spent the entirety of a $3,000 12 hour flight in the middle seat… \n\nSo I have a history with Turkish Airways, after my review earlier this year. Turkish cut back so much over the last 18 months and actually offered cold packed lunch boxes on their mid haul routes whilst still charging over $1000 a ticket. Today I was hoping this would be different, but my word I’m left with quite a sour taste in my mouth. Perhaps the most ludicrous part of the experience was ordering the steak to be presenting with slop on a plate… Yes they still promote their 5* dining onboard. My aim is to show the reality of flying premium cabins, and call out airlines when they don’t deliver on their promises. Remember this ticket was sold at $3600 so expectation is rather high. I hope that Turkish will indeed improve in the future, some fingers crossed and I will be back onboard to find out... when this day comes. \n\nThanks as always for watching my business class review on Turkish Airlines, let me know what you think down below. Play nice :)\n\nFollow me on IG: https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel",source:"youtube",source_id:"RaCsMRt3NDg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1636674208000)};

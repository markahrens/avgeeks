const data = {name:"American Airlines Full Flight | Dublin to Philadelphia | Boeing 757-200 (AA723) **with ATC**",description:"A full length full flight video in real time with American Airlines, from Dublin to Philadelphia, onboard Boeing 757-200 N936UW operating flight AA723 on April 1 2016.\n\n**Every moment of the flight included from airport to airport. ATC for full flight.**\n\nWe begin our journey outside Dublin Airport's Terminal 2, before making our way through the airport, pre-clearing US immigration, and boarding our ride for today: Boeing 757-200 N936UW.  Once we are all boarded we push back, but the crew are unable to start one of the engines - so we return to the gate for the engineers to fix the fault.  We finally push back and taxi to runway 10 for departure, where we depart almost 2 hours behind schedule.  \n\nOnce airborne, we head across Ireland before beginning our transatlantic crossing, flying at a lower altitude of 28,000ft initially due to heavy turbulence at higher levels.  We climb in steps up to FL340, before we enter a large area of further heavy turbulence which leaves the fasten seatbelt sign on for the remainder of the flight. We head down the east-coast of the US passing Boston and New England, before the cloud clears shortly before coasting in near to Atlantic City.  We then get a stunning view of New Jersey and Philadelphia as we get closer to the airport, finally touching down some 1h45m late.\n\nKey moments in video:\n\n00:00:05  Entering Dublin's Terminal 2, passing through airport\n00:11:00 Boarding the aircraft\n00:15:20 Captain's welcome announcement\n00:20:25  Safety announcement\n00:26:45  Pushback from Terminal 2\n00:30:25  Attempting to start the engines\n00:42:08  Captain announces we are to return to the gate\n00:45:30  Taxi back into Terminal 1\n01:06:25  Pushback from Terminal 1\n01:12:00  Captain calls for taxi, commences taxi to runway 10\n01:32:00  Lineup and departure from runway 10\n09:02:40  Captain announces descent\n09:08:23  Atlantic coast, New Jersey\n09:22:00  Approaching Philadelphia over New Jersey\n09:24:10  Commencing ILS approach for runway 27R\n09:29:09  Touchdown on runway 27R\n09:30:20  Taxi in to gate A4\n09:33:00  Deboarding aircraft and walking into the terminal\n\n\nVideo taken from seat 8F.\n\nAirline:  American Airlines\nFlight:  AA723\nAircraft:  Boeing 757-200 N936UW\nFrom:  Dublin (DUB)\nTo:  Philadelphia (PHL)\nDeparture:  12:47\nArrival:  15:41\nFlight Time:  07:54\nSeat:  8F\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/p7ObxH\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

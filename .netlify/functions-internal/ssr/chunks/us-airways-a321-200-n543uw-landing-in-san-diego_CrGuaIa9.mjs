But try and read it anyway ;)\n\nHello fellow spotters, I am back! Apologies for not commenting and uploading lately, but I was in San Diego on vacation :D I have about 3 hours of footage from San Diego, LAX, plus a nice tan ;) I drove up to LAX for a few hours and got lots of heavies (Yes, A380s too). Stay tuned for a \"dude8472productions goes to SoCal\" music video sometime this weekend!\n\nEnjoy this Airbus flying pencil landing in San Diego, while I wade through my videos and try to edit them all...\n\nThanks for watching!

It isn't long before we commence our lengthy taxi to runway 27L in the morning rush hour.  We finally get airborne and make a right turn, sticking to a low altitude until we are away from London airspace and we continue our climb to FL350.\n\nWe head out across East Anglia into the North Sea, passing to the north of Denmark before crossing the Norwegian coast and commencing our descent towards Gardermoen.  We make a smooth landing under cloudy skies onto runway 01R at Oslo, and taxi into our gate, before disembarking from the forward doors into the modern Scandinavian terminal.\n\nAirline:  British Airways\nFlight:  BA762\nAircraft:  Airbus A319 G-EUPO\nFrom:  London - Heathrow (LHR)\nTo:  Oslo - Gardermoen (OSL)\nDeparture:  08:27\nArrival:  11:03\nFlight Time:  01:36\nSeat:  17A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/43o4yQ\n\nVideo taken from seat 17A.\n\n***PLEASE SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, COMMENT, AND FOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, GOOGLE+ AND INSTAGRAM!!***\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

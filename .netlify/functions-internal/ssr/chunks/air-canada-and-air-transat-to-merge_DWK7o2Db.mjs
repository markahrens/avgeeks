const data = {name:"Air Canada and Air Transat to Merge",description:"Welcome back to some more developments in Canada’s aviation industry! On June 27th, it was announced that Air Canada and Air Transat have agreed to merge, after announcing over a month ago that they were in negotiations with one another to pursue a combination of the two airlines.\n\nIn today's video, I cover the statements from the airlines, as well as the future of the Air Transat brand. But I'd also like to hear from you! Do you think this merger will be better for customers in the long run, or will it just drive prices up for everyone? Let me know in the comments below, and thanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOURCES:\n\nhttps://aircanada.mediaroom.com/2019-06-27-Air-Canada-and-Transat-A-T-Inc-Comclude-Definitive-Arrangement-Agreement-for-Combination-of-the-Two-Companies\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",source:"youtube",source_id:"v12bm8Sa8RA",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1561672666000)};

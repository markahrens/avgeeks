I should know; I weaned myself onto flying solo with Ryanair! What irks me is when a budget airline is a sub brand of a full service airline, which decided to pull its full service from the route, substitute it with the cheap nasty budget carrier, and kept the fares the same. This is not a good product, and that's even after I lucked out by taking the (unusual) A330 on this route, normally reserved for longer trips. Weird food, a big delay, tired, broken seats and cabin, rubbish IFE...yeah, I'd avoid this if I were you, especially as they run this exact aircraft and meal concept to far flung destinations like Windhoek and Mauritius! :-)\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¬¶ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¬¶ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\nMerch store: https://wingin-it.teemill.com/collection/all-products/\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:31 Check in and terminal\n1:36 Fares stuff\n2:43 VIP Lounge\n5:01 AQRU integrated sponsor\n6:37 Boarding Eurowings Discover A330\n9:10 Taxi and take off\n10:45 In the air\n11:16 Seat tour\n12:23 The weirdest meal I've been given for a while!\n13:17 IFE woes\n13:59 Loo (with no view)\n14:24 Conclusions, landing, and thanks.\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me\n\nDate of Travel: 22 MARCH 2022\nAirline: Eurowings Discover\nLivery: Eurowings Discover standard\nRoute: LPA-FRA\nAircraft: Airbus A330-300\nFlight Number: LH 4279 (as sold)\nMiles: 1,979\nAirborne time: 3h50m\n\nJoin me on PATREON where you'll get perks like AD-FREE EARLY ACCESS viewing of all my trip report videos, my tips and tricks for hacking fares, my \"best of the month\" airfare rundown, and MORE...support me: https://www.patreon.com/winginit\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

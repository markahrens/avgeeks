Here's how, with a little extra time on our hands, we are still able to visit the USA.\n\nPlease note: Since filming this video, Mexico has been placed on the UK's red list - so we wouldn't necessarily recommend Mexico for the 2 week wait right now.  With Canada opening, that is probably your best option at the moment.\n\nOFFICIAL NOEL MERCH: www.noelphilips.com\nJOIN ME ON WHATSAPP, GET WEEKLY LIVE CHATS AND MUCH MORE - SUPPORT ME ON PATREON! http://patreon.com/inflightvideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"Zk6jkCVch5E",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1630843194000)};

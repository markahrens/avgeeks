We walk through to the gate where we shortly commence boarding.  Today the route is operated by a Jetstream 41 with no overhead bins so all bags have to be checked at the aircraft.  Then we board and take our seat in row 8.\n\nBefore long we receive clearance to depart to Kirkwall, and pushback and taxi to runway 34.  We make a departure to the north in the rain, which clears soon after takeoff.  We fly over the North Sea towards John O'Groats, the northernmost tip of the mainland UK.  We then start to see the Orkney Islands come into view, getting a great view of the outlying islands as we commence our approach into runway 27 at Kirkwall.  We make a cool sideways approach to runway 27 with a fierce crosswind, touching down on schedule before taxying into the terminal.\n\nWe disembark, walk through the tiny terminal and exit to the kerb.\n\nTIMELINE\n0:00:06 Inside Aberdeen Airport, walking to gate\n0:04:21 Boarding announced - walking to our aircraft and boarding\n0:06:33 ATC: Route clearance to Kirkwall\n0:06:52 Cabin view\n0:11:25 Cabin view\n0:16:53 ATC: Startup clearance\n0:18:24 Engine start\n0:19:27 Pushback clearance\n0:25:33 Taxi to runway 34\n0:29:03 Line up and wait runway 34\n0:30:01 Takeoff runway 34\n0:36:20 Cabin view\n0:37:25 Cabin view\n0:57:23 John O'Groats, Scotland\n0:58:13 Muckle Skerry, Orkney\n0:59:32 Burray, Orkney\n1:03:01 Copinsay, Orkney\n1:06:53 Final approach to Kirkwall\n1:08:01 Landing at Kirkwall\n1:13:53 Disembarking, walking through terminal to kerb\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"wzxhLauUYiE",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1513346386000)};

const data = {name:"Air to Air Over the Atlantic! Two Lufthansa A330s Flying Parallel at 38,000 Feet ᴴᴰ",description:"This was quite a sight! I've flown over the Atlantic countless times but have never seen another aircraft from my own like this. I was on board Lufthansa 474 from Munich to Montreal on D-AIKN, while the aircraft that I saw out the window was Lufthansa 414 from Munich to Washington, flown by sistership D-AIKQ. I decided to splurge on the in-flight wi-fi and saw on FlightRadar that LH414 was nearby. Eventually, our flight overtook LH414 and I was able to film this cool occurrence!

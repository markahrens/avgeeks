Free shipping to CA, US, AUS, NZ, JP, TW, KR, SGP\n\nJoin me today on one of the world's longest sleeper trains for 4 days, across the entirely of Australia from Perth all the way to Sydney on the Pacific coastline. I'll share with you all elements of this luxurious experience from an in depth room tour of both of my cabins - the Gold Class single roomette (Business Class) and the twin sleeper Gold cabin (First Class). Not forgetting Platinum, which is a class above First - but you'll have to wait until I try the Journey Beyond Rail sister train, The Ghan for the full review of that luxury train experience. \n\nAs usual, I'll sample the culinary delights onboard , from my favourite steak to some more authentic Australian cuisine such as Kangaroo or Camel curry!\n\nOur journey will take us to some of the most remote parts of the continent, including Cook with a population of just 4 people! I'll also get the chance to explore Adelaide during a pre-longed stop whilst the crew change and more passengers board the train. Ending in New South Wales on our forth day, the famous Sydney, just by the Opera House. \n\n0:00 - Introduction\n1:31 - Getting onboard\n2:37 - Roomette tour\n7:04 - The Indian Pacific\n10:10 - The Outback\n14:33 - Cook \n17:26 - The Bed\n19:18 - Adelaide\n20:33 - First Class\n23:27 - The Cost\n27:39 - Sydney",source:"youtube",source_id:"bMkOcbx0n-Y",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1661709621000)};

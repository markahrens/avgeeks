Twin Navion Airdrie to Drumheller (4K)",description:"Earlier this month, I had the privilege of flying in what is now the oldest and possibly the rarest airplane I've ever flown in - a 1955 Twin Navion!\n\nVery few of these fly regularly, and it was only thanks to a viewer of a previous video that I was able to tag along for a ride.

Today, Seaborne Airlines flights are booked through Silver Airways, but the airplanes are still emblazoned with the Seaborne Airlines logo.\n\nSeaborne operates a fleet of seaplanes along with airport-based aircraft. Our trip today would be onboard a twenty-five year-old Saab 340B.  \n\nWatch this video to experience the San Juan airport, a short – but memorable – flight onboard Silver’s Saab 340 operated by Seaborne, and (perhaps best of all) unmatched views of the Caribbean Sea.\n\n0:00 Introduction \n1:18 Silver Airways & Seaborne Airlines Routemap\n2:54 Boarding & Airport Tour\n4:02 Getting on the plane\n6:07 Takeoff\n7:31 Landing\n\nHere's a link to my Mystery Trip video!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdaYSYIOAbY\n\nFull take-off and Landing:\nhttps://youtu.be/tRd83gKZIJ0\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/\n\nJebBrooksFlies Check me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMUSIC: \nPlayful and Quirky Orchestral (Sting) – Gavin Luke\nNite Glo – Molife\nPurple Lilies – Sum Wave\nBahama Breeze – Sarah, the Illstrumentalist",source:"youtube",source_id:"wamM754hLjk",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1618063214000)};

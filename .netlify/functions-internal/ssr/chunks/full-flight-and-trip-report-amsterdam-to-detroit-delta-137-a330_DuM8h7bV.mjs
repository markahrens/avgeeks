const data = {name:"Full Flight & Trip Report - Amsterdam to Detroit - Delta 137 (A330)",description:"Thanks for watching this Full Flight Experience!  In May 2017 I had the opportunity to take a research trip to the Highlands of Scotland and experience some of my favorite locales in the world!  There were plenty of opportunities for walking, exploring, and recording my discoveries, and the fun started even before I arrived.\n\nThis is the last of a six-part series about this adventure, concluding with the last international flight home from Amsterdam to Delta's Midwest hub, Detroit International Airport. A short layover and a quick bite to eat, and we're ready to take the eight-hour flight back to the US. Like most westward intercontinental flights, this flight leaves and arrives in the afternoon, following the sun across the Atlantic.\n\nFor my last leg, we'll be riding along on a Delta Airbus 330, enjoying some in-flight entertainment, and exploring the meal selections for vegetarians and vegans while traveling. Before we know it, we'll back on the ground stateside, ready to bring this long journey to a close.\n\nThanks for flying in, and thanks for being a part of this trip with me! Soon, I'll be uploadaing another European trip, to around, and from mainland Europe.

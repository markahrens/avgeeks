const data = {name:"American Airlines A319-132 [N814AW] Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"Well, I was pretty excited to see this! Here we have an ex-US Airways Airbus A319, painted in the new AA livery departing Calgary bound for Phoenix. Once again, sorry for the shakiness, I'll try to avoid this spot on windy days. I also apologize for the lousy camera work when the aircraft rotates. I was expecting it to get airborne much later :/ Hope you enjoy, nonetheless!\n\nThanks for watching!

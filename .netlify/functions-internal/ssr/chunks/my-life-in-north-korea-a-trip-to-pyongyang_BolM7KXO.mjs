This short VLOG should give you a little impression of what it is like to travel to the DPRK or better known as North Korea.\n\nI went on a 3-days tour starting in Dandong, China. I went with Young Pioneer Tours and it was an incredible experience.\n\nI don't have an opinion on whether it was staged or not, whether they are bad or good, or how I feel about the whole trip. I went to the DPRK as a tourist and for a cultural exchange. From human to human, without a political agenda.\n\n▶︎ Support ME and become a PATRON for many more perks! \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/joshcahill\n\n▶︎ Follow me on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitter!\n\nhttps://instagram.com/gotravelyourway\nhttps://www.facebook.com/gotravelyourway\nhttps://twitter.com/gotravelyourway\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@gotravelyourway\n\n▶︎ My Website: http://www.gotravelyourway.com\n▶︎ Email Contact: gotravelyourway@gmail.com\n\nMusic by Joakim Karud http://youtube.com/joakimkarud\n\nLicence:\nhttp://www.joakimkarud.com/use-my-music/\n\nSong 1 - Flix & Chill\nSong 2 - Boost\nSong 3 - Vibe with Me\n\n#northkorea #joshcahill #china",source:"youtube",source_id:"uYggwA2wpnU",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1503663483000)};

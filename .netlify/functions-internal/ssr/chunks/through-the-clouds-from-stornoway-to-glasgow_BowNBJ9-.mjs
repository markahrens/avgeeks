const data = {name:"Through the Clouds from Stornoway to Glasgow",description:"Thanks for watching this Full Flight Experience!  In May 2017 I had the opportunity to take a research trip to the Highlands of Scotland and experience some of my favorite locales in the world!  There were plenty of opportunities for walking, exploring, and recording my discoveries, and the fun started even before I arrived.\n\nThis six-part journey starts its return as I head from the Outer Hebrides of Scotland back to the hustle and bustle of Glasgow for my continued flight home. Certainly one of the smallest airports I've flown from, Stornoway Airport offers a critical connection between the insular Western Isles to the rest of the UK. \n\nThis is a very brief flight, only about 35 minutes from wheels up to wheels down, but on a zippy little Saab 2000. It's still a pleasure to ride! Bear with me; auto-focus was notoriously difficult on the takeoff, but a clear window makes all the difference for our en route and landing!\n\nThanks for flying in, and stay tuned for the upcoming legs of this journey to and from the British Isles!\n\n--------------------------------\n\nFlight Information\nAirline: Loganair\nFlight Number: 6821\nDate of Flight: Saturday, May 20th, 2017\n\nOrigin Airport: Stornoway Airport (EGPO/SYY)\nDestination Airport: Glasgow International Airport (EGPF/GLA)\n\nDeparting Gate: 2\nBoarding Time: 09:04 BST\nScheduled Departure: 09:25\nActual Departure from Gate: 09:20 \nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 18 / 09:24 \n\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 23 / 09:59 BST\nScheduled Arrival: 10:10\nActual Arrival at Gate: 10:04 BST\nArriving Gate: 3\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAircraft Information\nType: Saab 2000\nRegistration: G-LGNS\nAircraft Manufacture: Nov 1996\nAircraft Delivery: April 2015\nEngines: 2x AE2100\nSeat: 2D\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\nCanon Vixia HFM30\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView\n\nAircraft, flight information, and facts developed from Planespotters.net, flightaware.com, Google Maps, and wikipedia.com.\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

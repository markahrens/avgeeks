const data = {name:"Five-Minute Tour: Huntsville International Airport (HSV)",description:"Thanks for watching this brief tour of Huntsville International Airport!\n\nAs a lifelong traveler, I never get tired of the process of boarding a plane going somewhere new and exciting, and one of the little pleasures I enjoy is seeing a new airport on my way to my destination.\n\nToday I wanted to fly a new airline, Silver Airways, so I made the drive about four hours south of Louisville to Huntsville, where one of their ATR-42s would spirit me to Orlando for a short visit. An early morning departure gave me plenty of time to explore Huntsville's international airport, the second busiest in Alabama. It received a modernization a few years ago, and the new facility is inviting and functional.\n\nThis tour covers views and travel information from around and inside the terminal, as well as facts about Huntsville's traffic, destinations, services, and amenities. I wasn't sure what to expect when I arrived, but I was pleased with the results. Huntsville's airport is an easy-to-use, efficient, and convenient place to start your journey, wherever you're going!\n\nI've provided two airport tours in the past, and this video is an attempt to revise and refine the methodology of these videos. Because airports can be confusing and intimidating for infrequent or first-time travelers, I want to make sure that you feel prepared when arriving at HSV, or any airport I cover.\n\nThis video was made independently, without implicit or explicit endorsement from any party mentioned or shown within the video, including the Huntsville / Madison County Airport Authority, the Port of Huntsville, any airline mentioned or shown within the video, or any third-party service provider shown or mentioned in the video. \n\nAirports are our gateway to the world, and I hope you enjoy this and other airport tour videos from Miles by Foot!\n\n--------------------------------\n\nGear\nNikon D3200/18-55mm\nCanon Vixia HFM30\nGoPro Hero 7 Black\nEdited in Adobe Premiere Pro/IrfanView/Audacity\n\nMusic - Fake by Andre Aguado via Epidemic Sound\n\nAircraft and flight information from Planespotters.net and flightaware.com.

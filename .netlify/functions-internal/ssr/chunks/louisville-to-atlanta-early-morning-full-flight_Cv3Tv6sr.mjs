This is the first in a series of four flight experience videos relating to my trip to Denver with my wife Beth.  We went for our wedding anniversary and, until the day of our trip, she had no idea where we were going; it was a complete surprise!  Follow our journey from our home airport in Louisville, Kentucky to Denver, Colorado and back over an exciting weekend of travel and exploration!\n\nThis first video covers the initial flight from Louisville to Atlanta on the route's first flight of the day.  The video includes a bit of \"concoursing\" in Louisville, boarding, taxiing, takeoff, climbing, cruising, approach, landing and taxiing to our gate in Atlanta.  We had clear weather for our early morning flight, which took place entirely before dawn.  \n\nMy apologies for the focus; autofocus is notoriously unreliable in the dark and getting the manual focus just right proved to be a challenge.  This is my first Full Flight Experience I've shared and I would love honest feedback in the comments.  \n\nThanks again for watching, and enjoy!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFlight Information\nAirline: Delta Air Lines\nFlight Number: DAL910\nDate of Flight: Thursday, October 29, 2015\n\nOrigin Airport: Louisville International Airport (KSDF/SDF)\nDestination Airport: Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (KATL/ATL)\n\nDeparting Gate: A3\nScheduled Departure: 06:00 EDT\nActual Departure from Gate: 06:01 EDT\nTakeoff Runway and Time: RWY 17L / 06:08 EDT\nLanding Runway and Time: RWY 26R / 07:03 EDT\nScheduled Arrival: 07:18 EDT\nActual Arrival at Gate: 07:08 EDT\nArriving Gate: B3\n\nAircraft Information\nType: McDonnell Douglas MD-88\nRegistration: N942DL\nAircraft Delivery: July 1989\nEngines: 2x Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219\nSeat/s: 27D & 27E\n\nVideo Highlights and Timeline\n00:40 - BOARDING\n03:15 - TAKEOFF\n08:45 - LANDING\n14:00 - DEPLANING\n\nTechnical Specs\nCamera: Nikon D3200 with 18-55mm and 55-200mm lenses\n\nA big thanks to my wife Beth as my assistant (and often primary) cameraperson throughout the journey!\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nThis video is the sole property of www.milesbyfoot.com.

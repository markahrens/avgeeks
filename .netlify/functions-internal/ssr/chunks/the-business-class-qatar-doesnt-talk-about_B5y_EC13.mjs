const data = {name:"The Business Class Qatar Doesn't Talk About",description:"You won't find Qatar advertising this business class.  \n\nThis flight review shows just what you get when you find yourself on one of Qatar's many narrow body A320 aircraft.  They fly these aircraft to various secondary cities in Europe and also into Africa.  \n\nThis business class is designed for short regional routes and for flights of 2, 3 or 4 hours it is perfectly fine.  My issue is that they are using this aircraft type on longer 5, 6 and 7 hour flights - yet charge the same fare as they do for their flagship A350, 787 or A380 product.  This doesn't feel right to me.  \n\nMy issue with this business class is not with the on-board service or dining - this is excellent as you'd expect from Qatar. Rather it's with the seat itself - it is a very poor second choice when compared to the flagship Qatar business class product that we see advertised all the time.  \n\nIn their defense Qatar is upgrading their A320 fleet to lie flat seats however this is a slow process so in the meantime you can expect to find yourself in this sort of business class cabin for some time to come.  \n\nMore info:\n\nHere's the link to the Rwanda Mountain Gorilla video I refer to:  https://youtu.be/t4nQQLmtUYc  \n\n\nFlight:     QR1346\nRoute:    Nairobi to Doha - 5:25 hours\nWhen:    February 2017\nAircraft:  Airbus A320   registration A7ADI\nSeat:       2A\nCamera:  Sony FDR-AXP55",source:"youtube",source_id:"e62BSHIwT7c",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1490970239000)};

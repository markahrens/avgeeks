ATC from entry into Irish airspace.**\n\nOur journey today begins outside the terminal at Birmingham Airport, early in the morning.  We enter the terminal, and after checking in our luggage head through security to the departure lounge.  We are soon called for boarding and we make our way to gate 55, to see our aircraft waiting for us - Aer Lingus' logojet EI-DEO in Irish Rugby livery.\n\nBefore long we begin to board and walk out to our waiting aircraft, taking our seat in row 8.  It isn't long before we push back, and taxi out to runway 15 at Birmingham.  We depart to the south, making a sweeping left turn as we climb to the northwest towards Liverpool.\n\nCruise altitude today is a relatively low 18,000ft on such a short flight, and it's not long before we commence our descent towards Dublin.  Today's arrival calls for a rare landing on runway 16 at Dublin, and as such we are vectored around quite a bit to establish on the southbound approach towards Dublin.\n\nWe touch down on schedule, taxying into a stand at Terminal 1.  We then disembark and have a long walk to Terminal 2, before going through the baggage claim and emerging into the arrivals hall, and walking to the street.\n\n\n0:00:06  Arriving at Birmingham Airport, walking into terminal building\n0:01:44  Walking to security\n0:03:22  After security, walking to departure lounge\n0:04:37  Overview of departure lounge\n0:05:08  Walking to gate 55\n0:06:07  Waiting at gate 55\n0:06:40  Boarding commenced, walking out to aircraft\n0:09:50  Boarding the aircraft\n0:23:40  Pushback and engine start\n0:28:25  Taxi to runway 15\n0:35:30  Lining up on runway 15\n0:37:15  Takeoff runway 15\n0:49:35  Looking around the cabin and seat\n1:20:30  Established on ILS for runway 16 at Dublin\n1:25:50  Touchown on runway 16\n1:27:22  Taxying to Terminal 2 at Dublin\n1:30:11  Pulling onto stand 301 at Terminal 1\n1:32:48  Disembarking the aircraft into the terminal through gate 301, walking along the airside connector to Terminal 2\n1:40:11  Baggage claim\n1:41:39  Through customs to arrivals hall\n1:42:45  Walking through arrivals hall to street\n\nVideo taken from seat 8F.\n\nAirline:  Aer Lingus\nFlight:  EI263\nAircraft:  Airbus A320 EI-DEO\nFrom:  Birmingham (BHX)\nTo:  Dublin (DUB)\nDeparture:  08:21\nArrival:  09:09\nFlight Time:  00:48\nSeat:  8A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/tlA5xi\n\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

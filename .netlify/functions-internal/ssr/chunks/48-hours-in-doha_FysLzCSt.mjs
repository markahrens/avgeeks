On a recent trip with Qatar the airline asked me to stop over in Doha for a couple of days to check out their stopover program.  \n\nYes I fully disclose that Discover Qatar paid for my hotel and touring.  But then I'm in the industry and need to know what Doha is like as a stopover destination.  In summary I was impressed and would like to go back and see the things I missed - like the museums and travelling further afield.  \n\nI hope you like this video. \n\nHappy Travelling\n\nDennis\n\nps - normal flight reviews will be coming soon.  Next up is Thai Airways 747 First Class - that was one amazing flight!",source:"youtube",source_id:"TrLB78ujZdM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1521659019000)};

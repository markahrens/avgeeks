const data = {name:"First Takeoff and Landing on YYC's New Runway - Air Canada 767 and WestJet 737 ᴴᴰ",description:"Well, here it is. Canada's longest runway is finally in operation, Runway 35R/17L. The first aircraft to arrive on the runway was a WestJet 737 from St. John's, which just so happens to be WestJet's first 737NG, and the first aircraft to depart was an Air Canada 767 to Tokyo. I was just in awe standing up there though. It's like a completely different airport. Sorry for all the shakiness, I was fighting some pretty serious wind up on top of pretty tall hill. Hope you enjoy, nonetheless!\n\nNOTE: Unfortunately, this location is only temporary. It was made by the Calgary Airport Authority for people hoping to see the first landing. It's right in the middle of what is a construction site, so I doubt I'll be able to get to it for some time :/ \n\nThanks for watching!

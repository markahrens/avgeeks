const data = {name:"Bumpy Approach and Landing at Edinburgh (Flybe Dash 8 Q400)",description:"A windy approach and landing into Edinburgh onboard Flybe Bombardier DHC8-Q400 G-JECX, operating flight BE262 from East Midlands (EMA) to Edinburgh (EDI) on 21 October 2014. \n\n**FULL FLIGHT: http://youtu.be/wdEukJXMAy8 **\n\nWe pushback from the gate at East Midlands before taking a single engine taxi to runway 27.  We then depart to the west overhead Donington Park circuit before turning right to the west of Derby and climbing to a cruising altitude of 24,000ft.  We then head towards Carlisle, before turning right over the Scottish borders and commencing our descent, flying a short holding pattern before continuing our approach into Edinburgh.  We are treated to a stunning view of the city of Edinburgh as we fly our final approach over a very choppy Firth of Forth.  The approach is very blustery with many engine pitch changes before we touch down on runway 24 at Edinburgh, after a flight time of 49 minutes.\n\nVideo taken from seat 7A.\n\nAirline:  Flybe\nFlight:  BE262\nAircraft:  Bombardier DHC8-Q400 G-JECX\nFrom:  East Midlands (EMA)\nTo:  Edinburgh (EDI)\nDeparture:  09:09\nArrival:  09:58\nFlight Time:  00:49\nSeat:  7A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/W8EWY3\n\nPlease enjoy the flight and feel free to subscribe/comment!\n\nGoPro Hero 3\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

On the first trip from Nairobi to Masai Mara flight, we were on an AirKenya Dash 7. On the second, from the Masa Mara to Nairobi, we were on an AirKenya Twin Otter.\n\nBoth flights were excellent!\n\nIn this video, I'll share our experience as well as some of the rules from AirKenya. \n\nHop inside to see what it's like to fly into the Masai Mara for a Kenya Safari. I've even included a few photos of the animals you might see if you visit the Maasai Mara Protected Site and National Park! You'll also see the landing (from the cockpit!!) in Wilson Airport right in Nairobi.\n\nWhich did you prefer? The AirKenya Dash 7 or the Twin Otter?\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nNice Out - Dylan Sitts\nIce Cream Social - Dylan Sitts\nJuicebox - Dylan Sitts \nAll Music from Epidemic Sound!",source:"youtube",source_id:"YQgZi9t8BT0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1529053374000)};

const data = {name:"RARE Hi Fly A340-300 and MORE! Windy Plane Spotting at YYC (4K)",description:"Over the past little while, we've been getting a few visits from various Hi Fly A330s and A340s, all apparently bringing rapid test kits to Alberta. \n\nMost of those planes have all been painted white though, with no livery, so it was very nice to see 9H-SUN, the only Hi Fly A340-300 painted in their new livery with the A350-esque mask around the cockpit windows! \n\nAlso included are some other visitors from the past few windy days here at YYC! Enjoy the video.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video!

JetSuiteX Airlines is now known as JSX. JSX Airline or JetSuiteX operates a fleet of Embraer 135's and Embraer 145's on routes between Arizona, Nevada, California, Oregon, and Washington State. \n\nI recently bought a ticket from JetSuiteX Airlines when I need to fly from Phoenix to Burbank. They were the perfect solution because they offered so much more than traditional airlines offering tickets at similar prices.\n\nJetSuiteX eliminates the extra time and hassle required by traditional airlines like TSA checks, massive crowds, and even jetbridges!\n\nI was so impressed with the service and overall experience on JetSuiteX and left hoping they expand their network beyond those five states. \n\nIn this video, I'll highlight everything you need to know to maximize your time on this amazing airline. From where to go, what to expect, and  who to look for, you'll see everything you'll need to know to have a great trip with JSX Airline a/k/a JetSuiteX.\n\nFull Take-off and landing footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/NvRE4pNPy5Q\n\nSponsorship Policy:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/sponsorship-policy/\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://jebbrooksflies.com\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic: \nOuter Circle - Flat Theory\nSmooth City - Flat Theory",source:"youtube",source_id:"HS6hqsp4Dus",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1579960803000)};

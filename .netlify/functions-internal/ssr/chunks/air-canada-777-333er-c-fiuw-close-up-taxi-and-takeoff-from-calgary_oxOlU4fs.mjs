This is the second time I've filmed her this week, and she's been to YYC 4 times since the YYC-FRA route became a 77W! Anyway, here she is performing her third flight on this route. I also made a new outro for my videos, tell me what you think about it! I hope you all enjoy, and watch in 1080p!\n\nThanks for watching!

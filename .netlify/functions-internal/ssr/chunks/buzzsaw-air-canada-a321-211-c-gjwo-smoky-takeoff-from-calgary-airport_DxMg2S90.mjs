const data = {name:"BUZZSAW! Air Canada A321-211 [C-GJWO] Smoky Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Off to YYZ again! Here we have Air Canada flight 130 departing a very smoky Calgary International Airport a few weeks ago at the crack of dawn on board one of the first aircraft to receive AC's new livery back in February. Along with that, I chose a great seat to experience some intense engine buzz on takeoff, and I'm really quite happy with the way this turned out! The smoke was due to severe forest fires in British Columbia at the time of filming which had significantly impacted visibility and air quality in Calgary, but led to an interesting effect on the sun. Enjoy the video, and the sound of these CFM56s!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVIDEO LOG:\n00:11 - Pushing back.\n00:40 - Engine #1 start.\n01:32 - Starting taxi.\n04:49 - Turning southbound on taxiway Bravo, with the filtering effect of the smoke visible on the sun.\n06:22 - Spooling up!\n07:15 - Rotate!\n07:50 - Climb power set.\n09:30 - Banking east, with some sunlight finally visible.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Airbus A321-200 (A321)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New (2017)\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-5B3/P \nRegistration: C-GJWO\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Toronto Pearson (YYZ)\nSeat: 12A\nCallsign: Air Canada 130\nRunway used: 35R\nLocal Time: 0600\nDate Filmed: July 17, 2017\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CGJWO\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"75F1As3HHso",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1501388212000)};

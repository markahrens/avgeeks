const data = {name:"Getting Around Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) - Complete Airport Tour",description:"Thanks for joining me on this tour of Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport! Today's tour covers one of the busiest airports in the country, and a major hub for both Delta Air Lines and low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines. Detroit's famous design makes it easy for transiting Delta passengers to get from A to B, but there's a lot more to see at DTW!\n\nDetroit's consistent expansion, modernization, and amenity focus have made it a fan favorite among travelers, and I'm here to show you why, or just to help you if you find your next trip connects you through Michigan's busiest airport.\n\nI do a lot of original research while preparing these videos, so please leave a comment below if you have questions about the tour or navigating the airport, and I'll do my best to answer them! Or, share your own thoughts and experiences about IND!\n\nFinally, let me know where you'd like to see next!

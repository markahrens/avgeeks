const data = {name:"Norwegian 787-8 RTO with lots of spray at Paine Field ᴴᴰ",description:"Hey everybody, here's Norwegian Long Haul's second 787 making a rejected takeoff at Paine Field, with lots of spray from the engines. It had rained a few minutes before, so it made for a really cool effect. You can also hear the glorious sound of those Rolls Royce engines spooling up (music to any spotter's ears) :D\n\nThanks for watching!

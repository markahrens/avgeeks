const data = {name:"Delta DL84 Full Flight - Atlanta to London Heathrow (Boeing 767-400ER) with ATC",description:"Complete flight on Delta Air Lines, flight DL84 with nonstop service from Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International (ATL) to London Heathrow (LHR) on Thursday 13 March 2014, onboard Boeing 767-400 N829MH.\n\nThe video begins at the gate in Atlanta, as we board the aircraft, and includes the departure from Atlanta at night time, heading up the east coast of the US before beginning our Atlantic crossing overhead Newfoundland.  We get a view of the stunning mid-Atlantic sunrise as we head against the sun into the next day, and then fly across Ireland and into the busy skies of the UK heading from Manchester down to London.  We then get treated to a stunning approach over Central London, with a view of many of the attractions, before landing on runway 27R and taxying across Heathrow to the gate at Terminal 4.\n\nPlease sit back, enjoy the ride, and feel free to comment!\n\nVideo taken from seat 26G.\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

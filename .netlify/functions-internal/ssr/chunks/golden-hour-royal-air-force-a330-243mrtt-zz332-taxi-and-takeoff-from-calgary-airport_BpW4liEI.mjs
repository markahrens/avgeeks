The light literally could not have been any better on this Royal Air Force A330, and I don't think I've ever filmed one depart. On top of that, it took the closer taxiway, and the pilots waved! Here we have ZZ332 taxiing up close on Bravo and taking off runway 17L at Calgary International Airport, minutes before sunset. ATC is included as usual, hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Royal Air Force (RRR/RR)\nAircraft: Airbus A330-200 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard RAF Grey\nEngines: 2x RR Trent 772B-60 \nRegistration: ZZ332\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - RAF Brize Norton (BZZ)\nCallsign: Ascot 2781 heavy\nRunway used: 17L\nDate filmed: June 5, 2017\nLocal time: 2130\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"ynLmm5I0HDg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1497838472000)};

We enter the terminal and proceed to the TAP check in area to check our bag.  We then head through to departures, stopping for lunch at our favourite eatery.  Then it's down to the gate where we board a bus to today's aircraft, Embraer E195AR CS-TTY.  We board the aircraft and have a minor delay while we wait for the captain to arrive from his previous flight!\n\nBefore long we taxi and takeoff from Lisbon, getting a great view until we hit the clouds.  We cruise north over Portugal and Spain, and cross the Bay of Biscay.  We pass overhead Brittany, France, as the sun starts to set, and commence our descent as we fly overhead Wales, UK.  Manchester is very dark and wintery when we finally pass below the clouds, and we touchdown on runway 23R at Manchester just a few minutes behind schedule.  We disembark the aircraft and head through passport control and baggage claim, emerging on a cold night in the Northwest of England.\n\nTIMELINE\n0:00:06 Outside the terminal in Lisbon, entering the terminal\n0:03:19 Walking to security\n0:03:57 After security, walking to departures\n0:08:32 Walking to gate\n0:15:18 Boarding the bus to the aircraft\n0:16:45 Bus ride to our aircraft\n0:20:04 Boarding the aircraft, taking our seat\n0:26:45 First officer's welcome announcement - letting us know about late arrival of captain\n0:34:09 Safety briefing\n0:39:08 Engine start\n0:41:35 Commence taxi\n0:48:36 Line up runway 03\n0:49:15 Takeoff runway 03\n0:54:40 Cabin view\n0:55:07 Seat overview\n0:55:49 Flight map commences\n1:27:36 Cabin view\n1:28:12 Seat overview\n1:34:58 TAP's 'Portugal Stopover'\n1:53:33 Meal service\n2:05:45 Snack service\n2:10:21 Cabin view\n2:35:13 Cabin view\n2:46:05 Commencing approach into Manchester\n2:53:43 Cabin view during descent\n3:01:38 Cabin view\n3:08:50 Final approach to runway 23R at Manchester\n3:10:20 Landing on runway 23R\n3:17:06 Disembarking aircraft, walking through terminal\n3:25:25 Baggage claim\n3:25:46 After baggage claim, walking to kerb\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"-s5lsr5SGGo",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1518789589000)};

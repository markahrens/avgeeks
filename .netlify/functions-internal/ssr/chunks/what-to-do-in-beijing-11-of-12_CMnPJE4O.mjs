It's a question often asked and I decided to make a video of my experience. I hope you enjoy it :) \n\nTT Website: http://www.TrekTrendy.com \nTT Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/trektrendy\n\nWith special thanks to Derek Fiechter for permission to use his music: Chinese Festival. Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRJdMxf_nuCR6C1ZMgn7Ug\n\nA weekend in China! Join me on a whistle stop tour in and around the Chinese capital of Beijing. Soaking up the atmosphere of this sprawling megatropolis, oozing with culture, intrigue and excitement. I spent just 3 days here but managed to see Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, Silk Road market and take a trip out to the mountains to see the Great Wall of China. \n\nI'll show you how to get to the Great Wall from downtown Beijing, how to eat locally and how to stay luxuriously at a reasonable price. Hope you enjoy the journey, and remember you can subscribe to TrekTrendy for more exciting trips around the world, where I show you how to travel for half the price!",source:"youtube",source_id:"HXDmSXUnzFk",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1454863170000)};

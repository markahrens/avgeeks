Most people take a ship here, but Iâ€™ll be flying in this luxury aircraft, which has a bedroom, dining room, separate lounge and bathroom. \n\nJoin me as I'll walk you through what it's like to fly onboard this Gulfstream G550. We'll land on an ice runway in one of the most remote places on earth. \n\nThis trip is run by the company White Desert on a trip called The Greatest Day. Other itineraries are available, for example a 7 day trip to the South Pole! Mostly the Greatest Day route is run by an Airbus A340 which is an ex Emirates aircraft featuring First Class, Business and Economy. This allows White Desert to offer more freight options, increase capacity of the route + allow for fuel transfer on arrival to their camp in Antarctica.\n\nI paid in full for my ticket like any other guest to show you exactly what's it like.  \n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:42 - The Gulfstream\n4:40 - Dinner\n6:51 - Sponsor\n8:23 - Antarctica \n11:05 - Exploring\n12:42 - The Cost",source:"youtube",source_id:"T1ryilN-WpM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1671390010000)};

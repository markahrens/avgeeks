const data = {name:"AeroMexico Boeing 737-800 Sunset Arrival at Calgary Airport",description:"AeroMexico is one of Calgary's international carriers that doesn't get much attention, mostly because of the questionable flight timing. They typically arrive around 2230 and leave close to midnight. This particular day though, they arrived with just enough light to get some decent footage!\n\nHere we have \"AeroMexico 612\" arriving on 35R from Mexico City, operated by one of their Boeing 737-800s. AeroMexico first attempted the Calgary route years ago, but restarted flights in June of 2017. They bailed in April the following year, but have now returned again, but on a seasonal basis.\n\nEnjoy this seldom-documented, yet regular, 737-800!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: AeroMexico (AMX/AM)\nAircraft: Boeing 737-800 (B738)\nFlight Number: AM612\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x CFMI CFM56-7B27E \nRegistration: N825AM\nRoute: Mexico City (MEX) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: AEROMEXICO 612\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: June 16, 2019\nLocal time: 2200\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",source:"youtube",source_id:"BpbHZjxC240",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1561503602000)};

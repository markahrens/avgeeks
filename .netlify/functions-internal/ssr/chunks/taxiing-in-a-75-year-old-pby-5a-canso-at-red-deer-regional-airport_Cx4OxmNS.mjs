Please take a look at their website and consider making a donation to keep this amazing aircraft flying: www.savethecanso.com\n\nWhat an amazing experience! This PBY-5A Canso, a Canadian-built version of the PBY Catalina, a flying boat used during World War II, paid Red Deer a visit on Sunday May 27th for the \"Props and Pistons\" event held by YQF. Needless to say, once I heard a Canso was going to be there, I wanted to catch it! While at the event, I spoke to the crew about their departure time, and one of them suggested I could tag along while they taxi from their parking spot for the show to an FBO be refuelled for their flight back home to Fairview, Alberta. Of course, I jumped at the opportunity! Enjoy this special footage from inside a historic World War II Patrol Bomber, starting up, and taxiing across Red Deer Regional!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"Iu0ZECuG_GA",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1527516268000)};

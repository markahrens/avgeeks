Classed as the worlds longest direct flight, flying over three continents! This is among one of the most iconic flights you can take, and one that’s taken many years to get to its current timing. Back 80 years ago when QF1 began,  this would have taken nearly 100 hours with 6 stops. As always I’ll show you exactly what it’s like from the bed, to the food service and even the luxurious onboard lounge. We’ll also explore the First Class lounges in Sydney and during the tech stop in Singapore. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n4:48 - First Class\n7:33 - Suite tour\n12:43 - Onboard Lounge\n14:08 - The Bed\n15:52 - The Cost",source:"youtube",source_id:"32yayUJhb1A",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1682886077000)};

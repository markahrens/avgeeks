European business class isn‚Äôt known for its hard product, so it‚Äôs on the soft product that airlines compete in business class. \n\nThis was a splendid experience and it‚Äôs easy to see why Aegean are highly thought of. Every aspect of the flight was delivered well. Boarding was slick and unfussy, staff were enforcing priority boarding, cabin crew were immaculately turned out, there were pre departure drinks (in Europe...yes!), the meal was first rate and not only good but actually interesting to eat...need I go on?\n\nWatch the video to enjoy the experience with me. Next up, I check out their Economy product from Athens up to Belgrade in Serbia. \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

After the aircraft is de-iced we push back and the monstrous GE90 engines are fired into life.  We taxi out to runway 15 at Birmingham before making a long steady departure towards the southeast, getting airborne alongside the terminal.\n\nFrom Birmingham we head southeast towards Oxford, climbing to an initial cruising altitude of 31,000ft which we reach as we reach the south coast overhead Brighton.  We take an unusual route today crossing south to France rather than the standard route towards the Netherlands, and cross the French coast near to Dieppe.  We continue southeast passing to the west of Paris, making a step climb to 33,000ft as we cross into the Mediterranean overhead Nice.  \n\nWe fly parallel to the coast of Italy over the Mediterranean and towards Crete, Greece before we pass into Egypt to the west of Alexandria.  We get a stunning view of the Egyptian desert as we continue towards Hurghada, before climbing to 35,000ft and crossing the Red Sea south of Sharm-el-Sheikh.  We then enter Saudi Arabia, crossing west to east.  The sun sets as we fly over eastern Saudi Arabia, and we fly down the Persian Gulf in darkness joining the queue of evening arrivals into Dubai.\n\nAs we descend into Dubai we make a very short half holding pattern before we cross the coast and the lights of Dubai before touching down smoothly on runway 12L.  We taxi into the beautiful terminal before the GE90s are shut down ahead of their next flight, to Southern India in just another two hours time.\n\nTIMELINE:\n\n0:00:05  Walking into the airport at Birmingham\n0:01:14  Going to security at Birmingham, walking through to departure lounge\n0:04:43  Boarding through jetway\n0:06:56  Pushback and engine start\n0:18:55  Takeoff from runway 15\n0:46:55  Overview of inflight entertainment system\n0:53:30  Cabin overview\n1:11:31  Cabin Overview\n2:23:00 - 2:45:35  Flying down Italy's west coast\n2:47:22 - 2:53:21  Sicily\n4:06:03  Lunch service\n4:12:14  Crossing Egyptian coast\n4:26:38  Nile Delta\n4:47:57  Hurghada, Egypt's Red Sea Coast\n4:50:52  Tip of the Sinai Peninsula\n5:02:31  Red Sea Coast of Saudi Arabia\n5:08:30  Hijaz Asir Mountains, Saudi Arabia\n6:03:00 - 6:23:56  Sunset\n7:08:05  Crossing coast of Dubai and city lights on final approach\n7:09:25  Touchdown on runway 12L at Dubai\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"3SZxKAW277U",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1489155807000)};

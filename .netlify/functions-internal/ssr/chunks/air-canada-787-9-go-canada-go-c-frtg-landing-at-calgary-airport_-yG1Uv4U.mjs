const data = {name:"Air Canada 787-9 \"Go Canada Go!\" [C-FRTG] Landing at Calgary Airport",description:"Being the official airline of Team Canada, at the start of the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, Air Canada introduced this 787-9 with a special Olympic decal, along with an identical one on a 777-300ER, cheering on Team Canada through the Olympics and Paralympics. Its visits to Calgary have been few and far between, although it did come 5 days in a row while I was off on my Delta flights (go figure). As the Paralympics wind down now, Air Canada will be removing the decals on their pair of aircraft, so fortunately for me, the 787 came back to Calgary one last time and I was able to see it! Hope you enjoy this special catch.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air Canada (AC/ACA)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (B789)\nFlight Number: AC845/ACA845\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Go Canada Go 2018 Olympics\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B\nRegistration: C-FRTG\nRoute: Frankfurt-Main (FRA) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Air Canada 845 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: March 17, 2018\nLocal time: 1600\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dude8472productionsYT\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"4jRLz4cKVW4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1521339668000)};

Well, there’s no better way to find out than to take a super long haul flight – from Australia all the way across the Pacific to the USA. \n\nJoin me as I spend 13 hours onboard a United 787 and enjoy all the travel comforts that Polaris has to offer. \n\nThis United Airlines Flight Review did not get off to the best start.

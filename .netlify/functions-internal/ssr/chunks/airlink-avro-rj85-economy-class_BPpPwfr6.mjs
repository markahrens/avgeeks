The Avro RJ85 is one of my favorite airplanes of all time and it's a rare one for me to fly since I live in the USA. This short, but sweet trip report highlights the RJ85 service from Airlink between Johannesburg, South Africa to Maun, Botswana.\n\nAirLink is a South African-based airline with a fleet that includes the Avro RJ85!\n\nThis Avro RJ85 is ZS-TCO and was delivered in 2001 to Air Botnia, but now flies for Airlink, which is an airline based in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nOriginally called the BAe-146, the airplane was improved upon in 1992 (getting, among other things, new engines) and became the Avro RJ85. Learn more about the history of the Avro RJ85 in this video while you're seeing what it's like to fly in a regional jet in Southern Africa.\n\nThis video includes the BAe-146 Takeoff. And you'll even see this Avro RJ85 Landing!\n\nThis four-engined regional jet is an AvGeek's dream! The video highlights the airplane itself, the seats, the food, and the service onboard. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nGalactic - A P O L L O",source:"youtube",source_id:"2s2DKFSAfRI",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1532077374000)};

Here's the full version of my landing in Toronto a few trip reports ago, on Air Canada's Boeing 767-300ER, in their Business/Signature Class Cabin. The departure video wasn't great, thanks to a heavily scratched window, but I moved a few seats back for the landing and ended up with this great engine view.

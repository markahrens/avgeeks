I have lots of subscribers who came to my channel through other train trip videos I've done - and you've been patient. Hopefully, this 30 minute bumper trip report (the longest I've ever done) will quench your appetite for epic train journeys. \n\nThis is a quintessentially American experience and is the  ONLY way you should consider going across Big Sky Country - if you have three days to spare, that is. \n\nThe Amtrak Empire Builder. Where to start? Well, here's the official route guide: https://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/229/381/Amtrak-Empire-Builder-Train-Route-Guide,0.pdf\n\nAnd here's a great description of the route from Wikipedia: The train passes through Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. It makes service stops in Spokane, Washington, Havre, Montana, Minot, North Dakota, and Saint Paul, Minnesota. Its other major stops include Vancouver, Washington, Whitefish, Montana, Fargo, North Dakota, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It uses BNSF Railway's northern route from Seattle to Minneapolis, Minnesota Commercial from Minneapolis to St. Paul, Canadian Pacific from St. Paul to Glenview, and Metra from Glenview to Chicago.\nFrom Seattle, the northern segment uses the Cascade Tunnel and Stevens Pass as it traverses the Cascade Range to reach Spokane, while the southern segment departs Portland and runs along the north side of the Columbia River Gorge. The eastbound cars merge into one train at Spokane. The train continues into the mountains in eastern Washington and northern Idaho. Amtrak organizes the schedule so the train will pass through the Rocky Mountains (and Glacier National Park) during daylight, but this is more likely on the eastbound train during summer. Passengers can see sweeping views as the train skirts the southern edge of the park, crossing the Continental Divide at Marias Pass.\nAfter three short stops near Glacier National Park‚Äî Whitefish, Montana, West Glacier, Essex (a flag stop), and either East Glacier in the summer or Browning in the winter, the train enters the Northern Plains of eastern Montana and North Dakota. The land changes from prairie to forest as it travels through Minnesota. From Saint Paul Union Depot, the train crosses the Mississippi River at Hastings, Minnesotaand passes through southeastern Minnesota cities on or near Lake Pepin before crossing the Mississippi again at La Crosse, Wisconsin. It passes through rural southern Wisconsin, turns south at Milwaukee, and ends at Chicago Union Station.\n\nI really hope the video speaks for itself. \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

const data = {name:"KLM Full Flight | Glasgow to Amsterdam | Boeing 737-900 (with ATC)",description:"A full length full flight video in real time with KLM, from Glasgow to Amsterdam, onboard Boeing 737-900 PH-BXO in SkyTeam livery operating flight KL1478 on August 29 2016\n\n**Every moment of the flight included from outside the airport at Glasgow to the terminal at Amsterdam. ATC for full flight.**\n\nOur journey begins outside the terminal at Glasgow Airport.  We enter the terminal, making our way to the security checkpoint and into the airside departure lounge where we spend some time watching the afternoon departures at Scotland's busiest airport.  Our aircraft arrives from Amsterdam, the beautiful PH-BXO in SkyTeam livery, which will be our ride to Amsterdam this afternoon.\n\nBoarding can only be described as chaotic.  We finally make our way down the jetbridge to the waiting aircraft where we are welcomed on board and take our seat in row 5.\n\nIt isn't long before the captain calls for our route clearance, and we are cleared to Amsterdam Schiphol airport.  We are told the flying time will be around one hour today, which will be a smooth and clear flight.  We receive our pushback and taxi clearance from Glasgow Ground and taxi out to runway 23 at Glasgow.  We make a beautiful buzzsaw departure towards the west, getting a great view of Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayrshire as we make our way southeast towards Newcastle upon Tyne.  \n\nOnce we reach the Scottish borders the cloud clears and we are treated to a stunning view of Northern England as we head towards Newcastle.  The coast comes into view and we get amazing views of Newcastle, the entire east coast down to Whitby and Scarborough, before we head out overhead Bridlington and Flamborough Head into the North Sea.\n\nFrom there we continue under the ATC guidance of London Control, who eventually hand us off to Amsterdam control as we commence our descent towards Schiphol.  The weather remains clear and as we descend we see oil rigs, ships and wind farms as we make our way towards the Dutch coastline.\n\nIt's a beautiful afternoon in the Netherlands as we cross the coast to the south of Noordwijk, and are cleared to commence our approach to runway 24 at Schiphol.  We approach over the Dutch countryside and Hooffdorp before touching down smoothly on runway 24, the Kaagbaan, and taxying into the terminal.\n\nWe disembark through a jetway into the terminal and make our way to the central terminal area to head for a connecting flight back to the UK.\n\nKey moments in flight:\n\n0:00:04  Outside the terminal at Glasgow, entering the terminal\n0:01:08  Walking to security\n0:04:14  Security checkpoint\n0:07:50  Walking to departure lounge\n0:10:27  A few movements at Glasgow, Thomas Cook A320, Emirates Boeing 777-300ER\n0:14:23  Our aircraft arrives on the inbound flight - landing and taxying into terminal\n0:16:15  Starting to line up ready for boarding\n0:16:47  Boarding\n0:39:23  Push and start clearance, pushback and engine start\n0:43:23  Taxi clearance, commencing taxi to runway 23\n0:48:37  Lining up runway 23\n0:50:01  Take off from runway 23\n0:55:30  Cabin overview\n1:01:58  Meal service - chicken wrap and coffee\n1:07:35  Newcastle on Tyne\n1:11:06  Hartlepool, Middlesbrough\n1:14:15  Whitby, Scarborough\n1:17:11  Filey, Flamborough Head\n1:29:47  Hand over to Amsterdam control, commencing descent towards Amsterdam\n1:30:50  Rear cabin overview\n1:39:45  Cabin overview\n1:43:19  Wind farm off coast of Netherlands\n1:46:16  Crossing Dutch coast at Noordwijk\n1:47:48  ILS established runway 24\n1:51:00  Touch down runway 24, taxi to stand\n1:54:37  Pulling on stand\n1:56:39  Disembarking through jetway, walking through terminal at Schiphol\n\n\nAirline:  KLM\nFlight:  KL1478\nAircraft: Boeing 737-900 PH-BXO\nFrom:  Glasgow (GLA)\nTo:  Amsterdam (AMS)\nDeparture:  17:06\nArrival:  19:06\nFlight Time:  01:00\nSeat:  5A\nFlight Path:  https://goo.gl/ViNI0Y\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCameras: \nWindow footage: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nAirport and onboard footage: GoPro Hero Session http://amzn.to/2eBZTag\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nYou need this for the suction mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\nScanner for ATC: Yupiteru MVT-7300\nRecorder for ATC: Olympus VN-741PC http://amzn.to/2fb4Lab\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

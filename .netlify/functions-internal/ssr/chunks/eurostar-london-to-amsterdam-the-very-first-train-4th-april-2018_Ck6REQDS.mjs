This trip doesn‚Äôt need much introduction. \n\nI was one of the few very fortunate passengers to take the first EVER direct public train between London and Amsterdam. Eurostar now run this train as of 4 April via Brussels and Rotterdam straight to the Dutch capital. \n\nIt‚Äôs an incredible service. My journey was made more special by the fact I was in Eurostar‚Äôs top class of service, Business Premier (explanation of classes here:https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/travel-info/travel-planning/travel-classes üôÇ)\n\nAs you know this is a particular highlight of this year for me so I really hope you also enjoy the video.

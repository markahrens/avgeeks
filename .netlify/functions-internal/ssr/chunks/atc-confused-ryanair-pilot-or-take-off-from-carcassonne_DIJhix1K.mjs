const data = {name:"ATC: Confused Ryanair Pilot | Take Off from Carcassonne",description:"Departing from Carcassonne Airport, France onboard a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 en-route to East Midlands, UK.  After a short delay to our flight, the air traffic controller tries several times to contact our aircraft, with no reply.  Eventually the controller gets a reply, but then has to remind our aircraft that we haven't had our departure clearance!  \n\nAfter getting everything cleared up we taxi to runway 28 at Carcassonne, departing to the west and contacting Toulouse Approach.\n\nThe full flight video to East Midlands is coming soon!\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

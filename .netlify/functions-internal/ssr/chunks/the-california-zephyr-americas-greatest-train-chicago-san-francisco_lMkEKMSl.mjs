const data = {name:"THE CALIFORNIA ZEPHYR: America’s Greatest Train! Chicago - San Francisco",description:"Amtrak's California Zephyr from Chicago to Emeryville (for San Francisco) is the greatest train trip you can take in the United States. I was lucky to take this wonderful journey for the third time - this time, in beautiful autumn. Check out my Europe by Train Bright Trip guide: https://www.brighttrip.com/europebytrain\n\nIt is the most scenic and culturally important of all Amtrak's rail trips, and the longest daily Amtrak train. 2,438 miles and three days of the best America has to offer - come for the rolling farmland, a stop in Denver, stunning Rockies, Glenwood Springs, Sierra Nevadas, and through wine country towards the California coast. I hope you enjoy watching this video as much as I enjoyed making it!\n\nNext year I'll be taking more of the world's finest and most spectacular trains. VIA Rail's four-day epic \"The Canadian\", the Hiram Bingham up to Macchu Picchu in Peru, the glorious El Chepe in Mexico, Amtrak's Southwest Chief and even the iconic Blue Train will all come to your screens in 2022. \n\nMerch store: https://teespring.com/stores/wingin-it-3\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¦ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\n\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¦ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me\n\nA few helpful links:\n\nMy friend Jeb Brooks' comprehensive accommodations comparison on Amtrak, far more detailed than I could hope to cover in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54SqYY_KwO0\n\nThe FULL route guide: https://upgradedpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/California-Zephyr-Route-Guide.pdf\n\nWhere I get a LOT of my train travel inspo, the incredible Seat61: https://www.seat61.com/UnitedStates.htm\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:50 Chicago Union Station\n2:27 Our route\n2:52 Amtrak Metropolitan Lounge Chicago\n3:55 Boarding the California Zephyr!\n4:53 Departing on Amtrak Train 5 for Emeryville!\n6:18 Across Illinois\n6:56 Roomette tour\n10:49 Let's talk FOOD\n11:10 SMOKE STOP!\n12:47 Amtrak Diner for dinner\n13:44 Bed and end of Day 1\n15:15 Day 2 - and a shower...\n17:30 Sightseer lounge observation car\n19:36 Reversing into Denver Union\n20:20 Denver Union station\n22:08 The Rocky Mountains!

Our aircraft for today, Airbus A319 G-EUOD is already on stand having just arrived from Heathrow.\n\nBoarding is soon announced and we board the aircraft through the forward air stairs.  We take our seat in 2A, with a great view of the engine.  Before long boarding is complete, we receive our taxi clearance and taxi out to runway 34.\n\nWe take off towards the north and get a fantastic view over eastern Scotland and the Cairngorm Mountains as we head south towards Edinburgh, climbing up to 37,000ft.  \n\nOnce we reach cruising altitude we are able to sample the new Marks & Spencer food menu onboard today's flight, although unfortunately they only have available a couple of sandwiches and not the salad I'd hoped for.  \n\nWe continue south towards Manchester and Birmingham, before commencing our descent into London.  We don't have to hold on the way in and make our way across the city of London, for a scenic approach onto runway 27L.  We get a fantastic view of the entire city of London on this beautiful day, before touching down early on runway 27L.  Unfortunately our stand is not yet available however, and we have to sit with our engines running for around 25 minutes ahead of the stand becoming available, before we can taxi in to Terminal 5.  We disembark through the airbridge making our way into the terminal, through the transfer channel and into the departure lounge for our next flight.\n\nTimeline:\n\n0:00:03  Inside the terminal at Aberdeen Airport\n0:02:14  Boarding announced, boarding the aircraft through the forward steps\n0:21:05  Safety demo and push back\n0:27:05  Taxi to runway 34\n0:31:30  Line up and take off from runway 34\n0:43:45  M&S Menu Overview\n0:47:47  Meal service\n1:26:49  Approach to Heathrow commences over North London\n1:36:44  Turning onto final approach over Central London\n1:37:50  ILS established to runway 27L\n1:43:21  Touchdown and taxi to holding point\n2:18:21  Finally taxying to the stand at Terminal 5\n2:22:29  Disembarking through airbridge into the terminal\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"lV5cntVGEYg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1486130547000)};

const data = {name:"SUPER LOW TAKEOFF - B-17G Flying Fortress [N5017N] Takeoff from Springbank Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"The Experimental Aircraft Association, or EAA, brought their Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress to Calgary's Springbank Airport for the weekend, where it flew a number of short flights around the area for some lucky passengers for the low price of $700 Canadian. I settled for spotting the aircraft's departure, where it was very heavily loaded on its departure to Regina, where it would do the same there. A heavily loaded WW2 aircraft combined with a 5,000 foot runway and a fairly hot day led to this spectacular low takeoff from runway 17. Some startup footage is included, along with the ATC.

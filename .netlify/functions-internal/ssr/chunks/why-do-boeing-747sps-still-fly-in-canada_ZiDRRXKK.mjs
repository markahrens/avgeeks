const data = {name:"Why Do Boeing 747SPs Still Fly in Canada?",description:"The Boeing 747SP is certainly one of the most unique looking airliners ever built. This shortened version of the Boeing 747-100, named the 747SP for “Special Performance”, was developed in the 1970s as a longer-range 747 variant. \n\nOnly 45 of these planes were ever built, making them one of the rarest airliners in the world. But, did you know that two of them are still flying in Canada?\n\nWith many thanks to my good friend @MarkBrandonAviation for his help with several of the clips!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOURCES:\n\n[1] 747SP History\nhttps://www.747sp.com/story-b747sp/\nhttps://knaviation.net/boeing-747sp/\nhttps://archive.org/details/boeing747designd00norr/page/74/mode/2up\n\n[2] 747SP Production Data\nC-FPAW: https://www.747sp.com/747sp-production-list/21934-467/\nC-GTFF: https://www.747sp.com/747sp-production-list/22484-507/\n\n[3] Pratt and Whitney Canada Mirabel Aerospace Centre\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20101006231955/http://www.pwc.ca/en/news-events/press/details/1329078\n\nhttps://skiesmag.com/features/next-gen-manufacturing/\n\n[4] TFF’s 5th Engine Pod\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7q24bwu7vw\n\n[5] Boeing 747 Test Bed Characteristics\nhttps://blog.geaviation.com/technology/ge9x-you-have-questions-our-chief-test-pilot-has-answers/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gSKbmODNxI 13:50 onwards\n\n[6] 747SP Flight Characteristics \nhttps://www.747sp.com/n136sw-scrapped/\nhttps://skiesmag.com/features/special-performers/\n \n[7] 747SP Performance\nhttps://www.key.aero/article/special-performer\n \n[8] Airborne Laboratories https://www.aviationpros.com/aircraft/commercial-airline/blog/10712153/pratt-whitneys-flying-test-bed\n \n[9] PWC 747SP Future\nhttps://skiesmag.com/features/special-performers/\n \n[10] General Electric 747-100\nhttps://www.ge.com/news/reports/time-flies-ges-original-flying-testbed-jets-off-history\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2022\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

const data = {name:"Delta to Retire the 777 Fleet",description:"Delta Air Lines announced the retirement of their Boeing 777 fleet by the end of 2020. This news is tough to hear. \n\nIn this video, we'll discuss the news, talk about the 777 and what made it special for Delta, and I'll share some of my Delta 777 memories.\n\nDelta's CEO, Ed Bastian, said, “Retiring a fleet as iconic as the 777 is not an easy decision – I know it has a direct impact on many of you who fly, crew, and service these jets. The 777 has played an important role with Delta since 1999, allowing us to open new long-haul markets and grow our international network as we transformed into a global airline.”\n\nThe Boeing 777 program was launched in 1990 with a first order from United Airlines. The first 777 entered service with them in June of 1995. \n\nIt was the first airplane to be completely designed by computer. And, because of the reliability and efficiency of its twin engine design, it would deliver a serious blow to four engine long-haul aircraft like the 747 and A340, accelerating their decline.\n\nDelta’s 777 fleet consists of 18 airplanes. Eight are ER variants and ten are LR variants. The ER’s have a range of 7,065 nautical miles. While the LRs can travel 8,555 nautical miles.\n\nSome of my most cherished aviation memories were forged onboard Delta’s 18 Boeing 777’s.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising aspect of this news from Delta. Barely three months ago, the airline completed a refurbishment of the cabins on these aircraft. A project that cost upwards of $100 million for the fleet. Proof positive that nothing is off the table as the airline attempts to ensure its survival.\n\nThis announcement from Delta about its fleet of 777's leaves us with many unanswered questions.  Questions I’d love to see you answer in the comments section below:\n\nYes, the A330s and A350s can replace much of what the 777s did, but will they effectively replace everything they did?\n\nWill all routes once served by the 777 come back? Will Delta return to India, South Africa, and Australia? \n\nThese aren’t old airframes, where will they go next? Will they become freighters?\n\nWhat aircraft types will other airlines retire?\n\nAnd, perhaps the biggest question of all…What does the future hold for Delta Air Lines and the aviation industry in general? \n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nThe Five Times I Loved You - Cora Zea\nOld Rain on a New Day - Cora Zea\nCelestial Siren - Cora Zea",source:"youtube",source_id:"qAmVlgH0p_s",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1589634010000)};

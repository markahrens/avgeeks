const data = {name:"FedEx A310-324F [N803FD] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"N803FD first flew in July 1985 with the registration F-WWCA as the testbed and prototype for the A310-300 series. It flew for Air Niugini for over a decade, and was then converted and delivered to FedEx in 2005. Glad to see this classic bird again, and I hope to get more videos of her! The sound and smoke on departure is just fantastic! ATC is included, hope you enjoy.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: FedEx (FDX/FX)\nAircraft: Airbus A310-300 (A313)\nAircraft Name: Rylan\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x PW PW4152 \nRegistration: N803FD\nRoute: YYC-MEM\nCallsign: FedEx 141 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: April 20, 2017\nLocal time: 1930\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N803FD\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"qe2uzNU750s",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1495461607000)};

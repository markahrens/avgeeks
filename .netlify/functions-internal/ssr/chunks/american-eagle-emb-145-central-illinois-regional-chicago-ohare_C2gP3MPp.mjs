The video features a spectacular takeoff and immediate left turn - quite an experience in the little Embraer! There are also some views of Chicago Downtown as well as some scenic highlights over Northern Illinois.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video - and please do leave a comment if you liked it!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"Olla38pa-ag",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1472823881000)};

But watch this video to decide for yourself!\n\nIn this video, you’ll see what it’s like in Flagship First on one of American Airlines’ most Premium Routes onboard an American Airlines A321. \n\nFlagship First is American Airlines’ most luxurious of First Class experiences and you’ll see it all, from the current “version” of a Flagship First Lounge, the Flagship First food, Flagship First seat, and even the Flagship First service.\n\nIn the current reality of travel, premium experiences are tough to find, but American Airlines has retained a surprising level of luxury in Flagship First between JFK and LA, San Francisco, and (777-300 flights) Miami.\n\nThe American Airlines A321T is a special airplane with an interior especially designed for these premium routes. In this video, we’ll walk through the entire cabin to see the 36 Main Cabin seats, the 36 Main Cabin Extra seats, the 20 lay-flat Business Class Seats, and the 10 Flagship First suites.\n\nBut, as always, let me know what you think of Flagship First.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:11 What is Flagship First\n2:44 American Airlines JFK Flagship First Club\n4:27 Boarding American Airlines Flagship First A321\n6:48 In the air in American Airlines Flagship First\n8:55 Flagship First Inflight Meal\n11:14 Flagship First JebScore Rating\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nEndless Dreaming – Digital Camel\nMake It Rain – Daxten\nConcussion – Nihoni\nDavds Harp – JOYSPRING\nA Genuinely Good Guy – Gerhard Feng\nGranny Dance – Scoobadive\nBetween The Lines (COE Remix) (Instrumental Version) – Elijah N\nEndless Dreaming – Digital Camel\nFierce Love – JOYSPRING\nLike It Like That (Instrumental Version) – Mindme",source:"youtube",source_id:"nYxpHhhz_yU",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1629561618000)};

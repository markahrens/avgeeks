const data = {name:"AVOID: American Airlines FIRST CLASS to Hawaii",description:"Why should you avoid American Airlines First Class? \nWell to find out, today I’m flying on one of the USA's longest domestic flights, onboard the Boeing 777. Hawaii is a place I’ve long been fascinated with, and I’m excited to have the opportunity to visit today. Unfortunately my flight over to paradise wasn’t exactly smooth. Let's take a deep dive, and comprehensive review of one of AA's flagship premium products.   \n\nMy first issue was booking said flight. I had a confirmation of booking, payment was taken yet no email or PNR was issued. After spending over four hours on the phone to their contact centre, AA explained that the ticket was essentially in limbo, and their payment system wasn’t able to handle my foreign AMEX card… certainly the first time that this has happened, anywhere in the world for me. \n\nI explore the lacklustre airport lounges, which you can only access if you’re a top tier member of the one world frequent flyer program (excluding AA's own program…). Even whilst in these lounges, you still have to pay for the vast majority of food and drink. Leading to question… why have a lounge in the first place?\n\nOnboard today I experienced some of the strangest service habits, where meal service was rushed, my tray table was forced down without me being ready… and overall not experiencing a proper “First Class” flight. Furthermore there was an equipment change (which I understand happens)… and there was literally no service for the vast majority of my 8 hour flight. \n\nWould I recommend flying AA to Hawaii based on this experience? Sadly not. Given the option of Hawaiian, from many US cities - I'd choose their A330. Yes it has a 2-2-2 but mostly when flying to Hawaii, you travel as a couple or family. \n\nAs always though, let me know what you think of today's trip report, have you flown over to Hawaii before on American's First Class? And yes before the comments... it is sold as First Class, but i'm aware that this is a international Business Class product or what AA call Flagship Business Class. \n\nFollow my travels live on IG: https://www.instagram.com/will.luxuytravel\n\nMy gear:\n\nGoPro Hero 8 https://amzn.to/3A6Eu2j\nBattery pack https://amzn.to/3C8t27b\nCannon G7X https://amzn.to/3noKxM9\nGorillaPod https://amzn.to/3z3hwYS\n4TB rugged hardrive: https://amzn.to/3z4zfin\n128GB Microsd https://amzn.to/3C8t27b",source:"youtube",source_id:"3hcswESM6Vc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1632088511000)};

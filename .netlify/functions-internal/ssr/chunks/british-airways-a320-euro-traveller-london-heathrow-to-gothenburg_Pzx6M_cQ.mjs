In this video I travel between London Heathrow and Gothenburg Landvetter airports on a British Airways A320. This is a great route to redeem Avios on - at just 4,000 Avios and Â£17.50 off peak, there's plenty of availability. \n\nWe fly on a lovely day across the North Sea and the Kattegat to Sweden. As always, all phases of the flight, the Galleries First Lounge, and food service are covered. Keep an eye out for my geography lessons along the way!\n\nThanks for watching, and if you haven't already done so, why not subscribe?\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"jF9pXGoDKSY",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1475483419000)};

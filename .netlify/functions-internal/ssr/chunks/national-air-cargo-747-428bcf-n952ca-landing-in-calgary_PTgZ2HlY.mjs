const data = {name:"National Air Cargo 747-428(BCF) [N952CA] Landing in Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"Here it is, the annual Spruce Meadows 747 charter! This 747 was bringing horses from Europe to participate in the Spruce Meadows Masters event on September 10-14, 2014. For us YYC spotters, this aircraft is always one of the most anticipated arrivals every year. Usually the pilot tries to put the plane down as smooth as possible for the horses, but I guess that didn't happen this year, as you'll see in the video. I hope you enjoy, and maybe I'll be able to catch the takeoff as well (I didn't last year, so maybe I will this year)\n\nThanks for watching!

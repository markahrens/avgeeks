This was part of a longer itinerary, LGW-MAD-AGP-LGW, so don’t worry, I didn’t pay through the nose for this very poor service!\n\nAir Nostrum business class still uses all the seats in the forward cabin, a tight 2-2 arrangement. There was a small (but tasty) sandwich served along with complimentary drinks.\n\nOverall a very pleasant flight, but I won’t be hurrying to cram myself into another CRJ in a hurry…\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTRAINS, ANYONE? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iSjr-5LbaA \n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek #madrid #airnostrum #iberia #crj1000\n\nMusic courtesy of Czech Vibes Sound\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",source:"youtube",source_id:"CivSeZlxZQw",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1497139189000)};

const data = {name:"2 Air Canada 777-333ERs Taking Off From Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"One year ago, 2 777s at YYC was an extremely rare sight. Now, it's fairly common, since the YYC-LHR flight got upgauged for the summer season, along with the YYC-FRA flight. I'm hoping for this to be a more common sight in the years to come :) The first 777 doesn't have much of a spool-up sound, due to background noise from the other 777, but the second one sounds AMAZING! (2:10 if you want to skip to it). I hope you enjoy, turn up your speakers, and watch in 1080p :)\n\nThanks for watching!

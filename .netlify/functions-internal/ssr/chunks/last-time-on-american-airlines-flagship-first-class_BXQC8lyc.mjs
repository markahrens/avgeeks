const data = {name:"LAST TIME on American Airlines Flagship FIRST CLASS",description:"Watch this video to see what it’s like to fly on an American Airlines First Class Flight on an A321.\n\nAmerican Airlines made headlines when they announced the end of First Class. And that’s why we’ll be traveling in this most luxurious way of crossing the country one last time to show you exactly what the end of First Class is all about.\n\nHere in the United States on most domestic flights, the top level of service onboard many airlines is called “First Class,” but it’s not what you may imagine. We made a whole video about this. I’ll link to it below. But here at American Airlines, on certain domestic and international routes, they’ve always offered what they call Flagship First which is more aligned with what you would find on international airlines’ first class. American is the last US airline offering a true first class, United phased it out in 2018 and Delta never offered a true First class product.\n\nIn this video, we'll highlight the American Airlines Flagship First experience onboard the airline's unique Airbus A321T.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:48 LAX Flagship First Lounge\n4:31 American Airlines A321 First Class Boarding\n7:17 American Airlines First Class Dining\n10:13 American Airlines First Class JebScore\n\nHere's a link to our Rockies to Red Rocks Train video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b-cecHEfdU\n \nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com\n \nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies\n \nCheck me out on Twitter, too:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n \nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n \nMusic:\nGame Face (Instrumental Version) - Love Beans\nIt’s All About Us (Instrumental Version) - Jaslyn Edgar\nIs This Love a Waiting Game (Instrumental Version) - The Big Let Down\nClub Soda (Indie Pop Version) - Martin Baekkevold\nMy First My Last (Instrumental Version) - Love Beans\nAlways on My Mind (Instrumental Version) - Paper Twins",source:"youtube",source_id:"s3Q9rNlSopM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1676736034000)};

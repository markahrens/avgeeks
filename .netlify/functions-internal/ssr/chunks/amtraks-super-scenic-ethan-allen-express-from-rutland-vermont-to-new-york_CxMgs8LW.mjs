const data = {name:"Amtrak's SUPER SCENIC Ethan Allen Express from Rutland, Vermont to New York",description:"The Ethan Allen Express is a beautiful Amtrak train journey from Rutland Vermont down to New York's Penn Station. It's especially wonderful if, like me, you do the trip in the middle of autumn. Enjoy the lovely \"fall\" colours of orange, red and green as we ride the 5 hours and 30 minutes in Amtrak business class south to New York on this lovely train.\n\nCheck out my Europe by Train Bright Trip guide: https://www.brighttrip.com/europebytrain\nThis year I'll be taking more of the world's finest and most spectacular trains. VIA Rail's four-day epic \"The Canadian\", the Hiram Bingham up to Macchu Picchu in Peru, the glorious El Chepe in Mexico, Amtrak's Southwest Chief and even the iconic Blue Train will all come to your screens in 2022. \n\nMerch store: https://teespring.com/stores/wingin-it-3\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¦ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\n\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¦ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:03 Rutland Station\n2:47 Boarding the Ethan Allen Express\n3:46 On time departure\n4:53 Business class seat tour!\n6:21 Cafe and breakfast on board\n7:31 Due south to Albany and New York\n8:10 Social media!\n9:35 Coach class seating, and toilets\n10:03 More scenery (wow - what a day)\n12:02 Arrival into New York Penn, and conclusions, fare paid, and thanks!",source:"youtube",source_id:"9fxhahCE-yc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1644750808000)};

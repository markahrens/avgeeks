const data = {name:"Swiss FIRST CLASS 777 from Zurich to Hong Kong",description:"Special thanks to Dashlane for sponsoring this series of videos! \nTry Dashlane for free at http://www.Dashlane.com/jebbrooks\n\nSwiss offers one of Europe's best First Class experiences. Their flagship 777-300ER offers the best example of Swiss First Class. \n\nI can't believe how fortunate I was to get to try Swiss First Class. Take a look at this video and let me know what you think of Swiss First Class!\n\nThis video highlights the Swiss First Class lounge (as well as the Senator Lounge) in Zurich. It also shows the Swiss First Class day rooms and the Swiss First Class a la carte restaurant. \n\nThe Swiss First Class experience only begins on the ground. The real \"good stuff\" comes in the air on a Boeing 777-300ER in Swiss First Class. \n\nThe Swiss First Class meals are spectacular! The Swiss First Class Inflight Entertainment appears on a massive 32\" screen. The Swiss First Class Service is definitely special. The Swiss First Class Seat, though...that's where this airline shines brightest.\n\nBe sure to watch to the end to see how I rate everything on this special Swiss First Class flight!\n\nHere's a link to my other (less than stellar) Swiss flight:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyQ6oYCe4uA&t=2s\n\nFor more videos like this, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nThe End of Summer: Ave Air\nBrand New Beginning: Gavin Luke\nWandering Soul: Gavin Luke\nIn Pursuit of Happiness: Gavin Luke",source:"youtube",source_id:"F0I5m5438lU",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1549219160000)};

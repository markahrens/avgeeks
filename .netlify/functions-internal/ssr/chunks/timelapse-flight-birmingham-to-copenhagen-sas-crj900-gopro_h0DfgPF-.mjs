We climb out to the east routing over the Daventry VOR, getting a great view of Rugby, Leicester and Bruntingthorpe airfield, before we hit cloud.  We climb to our cruising altitude of 37,000ft, and the cloud clears as we approach the English coast near to Lowestoft.  The weather remains clear for the entire North Sea crossing, before we cross the coast of Denmark south of Westerland.  Here the cloud builds up again, and we descend across  Syddanmark towards Copenhagen, making an approach from the north towards runway 22L.  After landing we taxi back to the terminal, parking on a remote stand.\n\nVideo taken from seat 23A.\n\nAirline:  SAS Scandinavian Airlines\nFlight:  SK2534\nAircraft:  Bombardier CRJ900  OY-KFH\nFrom:  Birmingham (BHX)\nTo:  Copenhagen (CPH)\nDeparture:  10:16\nArrival:  12:47\nFlight Time:  01:31\nSeat:  23A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/MJCYQT\n\nPlease enjoy the flight and feel free to subscribe/comment!\n\nGoPro Hero 3\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

const data = {name:"Qatar Airways Business Class & The World's Best Airport Hotel",description:"My latest Crazy Day Trip, flying on Austrian Airlines to Vienna and Cairo, before the world's strangest airport connection at Cairo, connecting from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 onto the wonderful Qatar Airways business class.  I then was lucky to stay in what I would consider the world's best airport hotel, The Airport Hotel at Hamad International Airport, Doha.  The airport is a five star hotel located inside the departure hall at Hamad International Airport, and features fantastic rooms and an amazing swimming pool and spa, perfect to relax between flights.  Then it's back to London Heathrow in business class onboard the wonderful Qatar Airways Airbus A350-900.\n\nHOTEL: http://inf.li/OHJ67\nJUST PARK: http://inf.li/oojsh\n\nThank you to Airline Spotter for your help with some of the footage!

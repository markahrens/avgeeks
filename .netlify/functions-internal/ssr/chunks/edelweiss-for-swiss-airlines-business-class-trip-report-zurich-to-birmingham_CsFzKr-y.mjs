Here, I take one of their A320s between Zurich and Birmingham on an early morning flight. This was operated for Swiss, so all the onboard service etc is governed by them, rather than Edelweiss. \n\nEnjoy the spectacular dawn light as we cross Europe heading for England, as well as all the usual highlights of lounge, onboard service and all phases of the flight. \n\nOverall, a decent flight - but having ditched BA some months back it does appear that they offer a better breakfast than Swiss. It‚Äôs not hard to microwave a hot breakfast...but hey, maybe it‚Äôs a cultural thing! I guess the English have a thing for cooked breakfasts!\n\nThis flight was booked as part of a complex multi-city itinerary with Swiss Airlines (including a 6-month stopover and a surface sector) so the costs I paid probably won‚Äôt be reflective of your own plans, if you‚Äôre interested!\n\nI have lots of videos coming out, including in midweek in the run up to New Year. Make sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

const data = {name:"Flybe Full Flight | Birmingham to Edinburgh | Embraer E175",description:"Full length, real time full flight video from gate to gate onboard Flybe Embraer E175 G-FBJA, operating flight BE849 from Birmingham to Edinburgh on 29 October 2014.  \n\n*Every minute of the flight included from gate to gate*\n\nWe pushback from the gate at a gloomy, rainy Birmingham, taxying out to runway 15.  After a short wait for a landing ATR we depart to the south, making a sweeping left hand turn to emerge through the cloud into the sunshine on a northwesterly heading.  We head towards Manchester before turning slightly right towards Carlisle and the Lake District, where the cloud dissipates and affords us a beautiful sunset view across the north of England and the Scottish borders.  We make a series of turns as we head towards Edinburgh, before crossing into the Firth of Forth near to Musselburgh, and turning left for an ILS approach to runway 24.  \n\nVideo taken from seat 16D.\n\nAirline:  Flybe\nFlight:  BE849\nAircraft:  Embraer E-175 G-FBJA\nFrom:  Birmingham (BHX)\nTo:  Edinburgh (EDI)\nDeparture:  15:13\nArrival:  16:00\nFlight Time:  00:47\nSeat:  7A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/f06H4Q\n\nPlease enjoy the flight and feel free to subscribe/comment!\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

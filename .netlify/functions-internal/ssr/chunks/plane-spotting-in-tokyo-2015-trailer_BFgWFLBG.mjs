const data = {name:"Plane Spotting in Tokyo (2015 Trailer) ᴴᴰ",description:"This past week, I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, in an endeavor to experience a new culture and way of life on the other side of the world. And, of course, to do some plane spotting at Tokyo's Haneda and Narita airports, and to take my very first flight on a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, with Air Canada. This trailer is just a small bit of the footage to be seen on my channel in the coming weeks and months. Enjoy! :)\n\nThanks for watching!

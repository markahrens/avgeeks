I was even the first passenger to ever check-in with Silver Airways!\n\nThere’s not a lot of services or features onboard, but we’ll still explore them all. \n\nWe’ll even give the experience a JebScore! We modified the Lounge score to better reflect an Economy Experience by focusing on the Ground Experience with things like boarding, communication, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, Suzanne couldn’t join me on this trip, but she’ll be back soon!!\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:24 Water Canon Salute\n3:45 Departing Greensboro\n6:31 JebScore\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nMore videos about Propeller planes:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQhp4hw0kFepjHkKYKza7ID1dvJJQ3KiL\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.Instagram.com/JebBrooksFlies \n\nCheck me out on Twitter, too: \nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks \n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nAmore estivo – Duke Herrington\nBreak Times – Phello\nUP2U – Twelwe\nThe Path to Innovation – Airae\nPower Break – Bastien Slice\nNever Stop Reaching for the Stars – Airae\nAmore estivo – Duke Herrington",source:"youtube",source_id:"4I15wD28Tf4",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1691248447000)};

const data = {name:"DIVERSION! Air China Cargo 777-FFT [B-2091] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Air China Cargo serves another city in Alberta, Edmonton (CYEG/YEG) 3 times a week with their 777F. Today, Edmonton had some very dense fog, down to 1/8SM at one point, leading to dozens of diversion, some to YMM but most to YYC, including this Air China Cargo 777F. I've caught this bird multiple times in Edmonton, but it sure was nice to see her here! It came in around 6AM directly from Shanghai, attempted to leave around 8:50 and remained on the taxiway for over an hour before being forced to park as their duty hours had run out. It finally left after 14 hours on the ground, and here she is departing off to Edmonton. ATC is included, along with a FANTASTIC spool up sound. Enjoy this special catch!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Air China Cargo (CAO/CA)\nAircraft: Boeing 777F (77F)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE90-110B1L\nRegistration: B-2091\nRoute: (PVG)-YYC-YEG-(ORD)\nCallsign: Air China Freight 1067 heavy\nRunway used: 35L\nLocal Time: 1950\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CAO1076\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"jVGZUGZaG5k",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1485407511000)};

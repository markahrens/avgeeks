const data = {name:"FLYING the World’s BEST BUSINESS CLASS *Lockdown Edition*",description:"Is this still the world's best Business Class? What's changed? Do you still get the same service, food and overall experience whilst travelling in these testing lockdown times? I got the chance to travel on what’s widely regarded as the world’s best business class, which even challenges many First Class products out there. This was a fascinating experience and I hope you enjoy the flight with me. \n\nOf course there were several challenges to do this, and usually this would involve flying long haul. How is it possible to do so when the world is still locked down? Well follow my journey, I’ll share with you each step of the way. What’s more I also have had the chance to try another competing business class product, offering an interesting comparison to the world’s best. I can tell you now, sadly it falls flat… but then again don’t take my word for it, take a look and let me know in the comments below. \n\nThe flight was taken on two of Qatar’s 777-300. One was refurbished with QSuites (as this is what they’re doing across their fleet at present) and the other was a new 777 with their latest and newest version of the product. Subtle difference in the finishes, and increase height of the suite itself. Other things to note and what we’ll be finding out today is what the food is like? So many airlines have substantially cut their offerings. In fact the first flight is a prime example of this. However Qatar has proceeded to offer it’s business class passengers as revised and adapted service, still maintaining a very high level of quality and value for your ticket. Super impressed on this one! What's more on today's flight I got the entire mini cabin to myself. This allowed me to try out all the different variants of QSuites. This includes the double bed, and varieties of single QSuites. Let's not forget the Quad!\n\nIt also offers an interesting insight into what longer haul flying is like at present, the difficulties with boarders changing, airports having varied rules and having to wear a mask constantly. \n\nAs always let me know what you think below. And if you’d fly on Qatar Business Class in a double bed?\n\nFollow my travel live on IG : will.luxurytravel\n\nQatar Airways\nQatar Airways QSuites\nQatar Airways Business Class\nBusiness Class travel \nBest Business Class in the world\nTurkish Airlines Business Class A330\nQatar Airways 777-300\nAirbus A330 Turkish \nIstanbul to Doha Qatar Airways\nDoha to Frankfurt QSuites\nThe best business class in the world\nBest premium product \nFirst Class airline product",source:"youtube",source_id:"-IymP0zFlR8",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1596742404000)};

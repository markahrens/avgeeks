const data = {name:"DIVERSION! American Airlines Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner Takeoff from Calgary Airport",description:"On Thursday, October 11, this American Airlines Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, N814AA, operating AA263 from Dallas to Beijing diverted to Edmonton while around the 60th parallel north due to a medical emergency on board. On approach into Edmonton, the crew discovered a flap problem, forcing them to divert a second time to Calgary, where we have the longest runway in Canada (at 14,000 feet), without flaps. They landed safely, using almost all of runway 17L/35R, and a rescue aircraft was brought in from Dallas with a maintenance crew for N814AA and to take the passengers to Beijing the following day. Two days after its dramatic diversion, here we have N814AA departing on a ferry flight back to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport! Glad to see this bird on the move, even if it left after dark. To my knowledge, this also was the first American-registered 787 ever to land here in Calgary! Enjoy this departure video, with ATC included.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: American Airlines (AAL/AA)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner (B788)\nFlight Number: AA9648\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: New (2013)\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B\nRegistration: N814AA\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)\nCallsign: AMERICAN 9648 heavy\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: October 13, 2018\nLocal time: 2000\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2018\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions / Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission. \n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"hqEPytr2jAc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1539532931000)};

WestJet's first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, registered as C-GUDH, was delivered new from Paine Field in Everett, Washington, to Calgary, Alberta, this evening, in some awful weather conditions. It's great to finally see this aircraft here, an aircraft which will no doubt have an impact on aviation in Canada. Pity it arrived in darkness and in some stereotypically Canadian weather, but I genuinely look forward to seeing \"The Spirit of Canada\" for many years to come!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner\nFlight Number: WS8968\nLivery: New (2018)\nEngines: 2x GEnx-1B\nRegistration: C-GUDH\nRoute: Paine Field (PAE) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: WESTJET 8968 heavy\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: January 17, 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel.",source:"youtube",source_id:"EyyVSg-2OM0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1547786497000)};

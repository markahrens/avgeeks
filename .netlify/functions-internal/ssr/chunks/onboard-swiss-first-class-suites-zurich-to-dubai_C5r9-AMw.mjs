const data = {name:"ONBOARD Swiss First Class Suites *Zürich to Dubai*",description:"Head to https://squarespace.com/trektrendy to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain using code TREKTRENDY\n\nToday I’m onboard Swiss International Airlines First Class, in their suites. Flying from Zurich, Switzerland all the way over to Dubai. Given that I’ve now flown Air France La Premiere, Lufthansa First Class and British Airways First, this is the last European First Class to complete the set - and will offer a valuable comparison in todays trip report. This product is flown exclusively onboard the Airbus A330, with the newest suites offered on retrofitted Boeing 777s and Airbus A340s. \n\nIt goes without saying this is one expensive product to fly, costing upwards of $5,000 so expectations for this are high. I’ll showcase to you the ground experience, such as Mercedes S Class transfers, the lounge but also my gripes with Hon Circle status…. showcased on my previous Swiss Business Class flight over to Zurich. I’ll be reviewing the experience in-depth on board, including the food, drink, service, bedding and the amenity kit. As always let me know what you think down below and what other products you’d like to see on my channel in the future. \n\nFollow my travels live on IG: https://www.instagram.com/will.luxurytravel\n\nMy gear:\nGoPro Hero 8 https://amzn.to/3A6Eu2j\nBattery pack https://amzn.to/3C8t27b\nCannon G7X https://amzn.to/3noKxM9\nGorillaPod https://amzn.to/3z3hwYS\n4TB rugged hardrive: https://amzn.to/3z4zfin\n128GB Microsd https://amzn.to/3C8t27b",source:"youtube",source_id:"Dfb7Qau0aYo",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1631484027000)};

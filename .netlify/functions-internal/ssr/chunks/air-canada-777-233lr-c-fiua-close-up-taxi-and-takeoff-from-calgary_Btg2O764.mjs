const data = {name:"Air Canada 777-233LR [C-FIUA] Close Up Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"Aircraft downgauges, cold weather, and oh look, it's starting to snow as I type this... Must be winter :P Here is C-FIUA departing Calgary International Airport for Frankfurt, on its second flight after the route was downgraded from the 77W. We get the 777s again next year (both from Air Canada and KLM) and the 777-200LR will be serving the route until January.\n\nQuite the lighting at 00:27, wouldn't you say? Check out the sharp turn that the aircraft makes shortly after lifting off to avoid those storm clouds right in its path. I am very pleased as to how this footage turned out, it was insanely windy and my camera blocked out a lot of the wind noise and the footage is quite stable. I hope you enjoy, and stay tuned for lots of exciting videos to come!\n\nThanks for watching!

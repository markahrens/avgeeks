const data = {name:"Delta Air Lines 767-400 Business Class +  The Largest Delta Sky Club",description:"In this video we’ll pick up where we left off at Salt Lake City International Airport. We’ll head inside the Delta Sky Club at Salt Lake City International Airport.\n\n0:00 Welcome and Introduction\n0:31 Delta’s Largest Sky Club\n1:38 Boarding Delta 767-400 Business Class\n2:37 Delta’s Previous 767-400 Delta One Cabin\n3:45 Delta 767-400 Delta One Seat Tour\n5:39 Take-off\n6:48 Fully Lie Flat Delta One 767-400 Seat\n7:30 Landing and Final Thoughts\n\nAt 28,000 square feet, the Salt Lake City Delta Sky Club is bigger than eleven average sized houses in the United States, combined! \n\nThe SLC Delta Sky Club contains two food stations that overflowed with individually packaged food. There were two full-service bars (but only one was open during our visit). There are five self-serve coffee stations, high speed wifi, power outlets at nearly every seat, panoramic views, and even a fireplace. \n\nBut, by far my favorite part of the Delta Sky Club at Salt Lake City was the Sky Deck, which offers sweeping views of the action out on the airfield.\n\nThen, we’ll hop onboard a Delta 767-400 in Business Class (a/k/a First Class). It’s the airplane with the newest cabin in the entire Delta Air Lines fleet. The Delta One Suite is a much needed upgrade over the previous version. We’ll look at the seat itself, the inflight entertainment, the fully lie flat bed, and the incredible views from the window as we travel three hours in complete comfort at 39,000 feet. We’ll even compare the Delta 767-400 Business Class Seat to United Airlines’ version of the 767-400.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Matt Cochran for the thumbnail image for this video!

And that's great. United were so close to getting full marks on this review so it was so FRUSTRATING to see the tail end of deep cost-cutting and product laziness in the food. This was the worst business class food I've had across the Atlantic for some time and definitely below what their competitors were offering. So while the rest of the experience (including their good management of a delay) was superb....sorry but you can't have a 10 on this one guys! Good news though, the food is being fixed as a priority and I was very impressed with everything else. The Polaris Lounge is great at SFO, super crew, good delay management, a fine seat, excellent bedding, cracking IFE and speedy WiFi mean there isn't much more to ask of the airline...other than to hurry up and fix the darned food. ;-D\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¬¶ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¬¶ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\nMerch store: https://wingin-it.teemill.com/collection/all-products/\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:10 SFO Airport \n2:00 Polaris Lounge @ SFO and private dining (excellent)\n4:00 Terrace, integrated sponsor message, United provides great delay experience\n5:51 Our aircraft, a Boeing 777-300ER\n6:24 Boarding United 777-300ER Polaris\n7:57 Taxi and takeoff\n9:14 Bay Area views\n9:42 Seat details\n11:03 The food problem\n12:15 Evening time...sleep time...\n13:17 Flat bed\n13:42 Breakfast, entertainment and approach into FRA\n15:00 Conclusions, fare paid, thanks.\n\nMerch store: https://teespring.com/stores/wingin-it-3\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit ¬¶ https://twitter.com/paul_winginit\n\nFollow me on Instagram: paul_winginit ¬¶ https://www.instagram.com/paul_winginit\n\nMy website: www.winginit.me\n\nDate of Travel: 5 APRIL 2022\nAirline: United\nLivery: United standard old gold globe livery \nRoute: SFO-FRA\nAircraft: Boeing 777-300ER\nFlight Number: UA 58\nMiles: 5,685\nAirborne time: 10h36m\n\nJoin me on PATREON where you'll get perks like AD-FREE EARLY ACCESS viewing of all my trip report videos, my tips and tricks for hacking fares, my \"best of the month\" airfare rundown, and MORE...support me: https://www.patreon.com/winginit\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @paul_winginit. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

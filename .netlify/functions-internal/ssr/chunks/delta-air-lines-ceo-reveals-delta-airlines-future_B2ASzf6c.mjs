const data = {name:"Delta Air Lines' CEO Reveals Delta Airlines' Future",description:"Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines sat down with me, a customer who flies more than 140,000 miles with Delta Airlines every year. In this interview, Ed Bastian discussed his role, the \"Delta Difference,\" and the future of the passenger experience at Delta and beyond.\n\nThe role of CEO of Delta Air Lines is a pretty interesting Airline Executive position and Ed Bastian has a unique perspective on the industry, Delta Airlines, (and its 80,000+ employees).\n\nI sent an email to Ed Bastian, the Delta CEO, on a whim. I didn't expect to hear back, but I did...within just a few minutes! Delta CEO Ed Bastioan was eager to connect with the folks who watch this channel. It was an opportunity for him to speak with you!\n\nIt's not that often that an Airline Executive gets to sit down with a customer and camera. Watch to the very end to find out what this leader thinks of the future of the Passenger Experience. \n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nCity Night Lights - Hakan Eriksson\nDelicate Acoustics - Orjan Karlsson\nHolding On To You - Johan Glossner",source:"youtube",source_id:"AzxCNB3Xt4s",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1535101377000)};

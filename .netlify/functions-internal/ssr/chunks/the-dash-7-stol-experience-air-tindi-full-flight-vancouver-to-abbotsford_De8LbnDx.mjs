const data = {name:"THE DASH 7 STOL EXPERIENCE - Air Tindi Full Flight Vancouver to Abbotsford",description:"On August 10th, an aviation enthusiast charter flight was organized on board an Air Tindi de Havilland Canada Dash 7, a short hop from Vancouver International Airport to Abbotsford, during the Abbotsford Airshow.\n\nFor many, this was the only way to fly a Dash 7 within Canada as Air Tindi uses them on charter flights up north mostly, and it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up!\n\nAbout 30 of us signed up for this once-in-a-lifetime avgeek experience, flying from Vancouver to Abbotsford early that morning, staying the day in Abbotsford for the show, before flying back to Vancouver in the evening.\n\nWhile I sat on the other side in seat 4A on this leg, I left a GoPro rolling to capture the wonderful wing view from the first row on the right side of the aircraft.\n\nThere were some beautiful sights as we flew over downtown Vancouver and the Lower Mainland. And of course, a thrilling high performance takeoff and a super short landing roll to top it all off.\n\nSit back, relax, and enjoy the Dash 7 experience!\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nEngine #4 startup: 04:10\nTaxi starts: 06:50\nFlight Deck Announcement: 08:50\nEngine #3 startup: 10:30\nTakeoff from YVR 08R: 15:40\nFlying over downtown Vancouver: 21:50\nLanding in Abbotsford: 42:40\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ap.aviationphotography\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPYYC\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: http://www.alexpraglowski.ca\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Tindi (8T)\nAircraft: de Havilland Canada Dash 7 (DHC7)\nFlight Number: 8T804\nSeat: 1F\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-50\nRegistration: C-GFFL\nRoute: Vancouver (YVR) - Abbotsford (YXX)\nCallsign: TINDI 804\nRunway used: 08L (YVR) - 07 (YXX)\nDate filmed: August 10, 2019\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcrp8_5nooSYwSL1dpX3DA\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2019\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.\n\nMEDIA: Please contact me at the email in the \"About\" section of my channel for usage.",source:"youtube",source_id:"bPhbF_jpe_U",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1570241227000)};

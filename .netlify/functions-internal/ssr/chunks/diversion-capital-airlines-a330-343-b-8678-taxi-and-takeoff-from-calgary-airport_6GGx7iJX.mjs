const data = {name:"DIVERSION! Capital Airlines A330-343 [B-8678] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport",description:"Today, Capital Airlines flight 471 from Qingdao to Vancouver diverted to Calgary due to fog! Capital Airlines is a fairly new airline in North America, starting service to Vancouver at the end of 2016, which is currently its only North American destination. They serve Vancouver from Qingdao, China, with a tag-on to Hangzhou. In this case, they flew to Vancouver, did a loop, then headed right to Calgary, as they don't have CAT II/III certification in Canada apparently.

const data = {name:"Louisville International Airport - SDF - Complete Airport Tour",description:"Thanks for watching this full tour of Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport!\n\nEvery traveler loves to explore the world, but eventually, the time comes to return, and SDF has been my home airport for the majority of my life. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I've gained a new appreciation for our airport, and I'd like to share how it looks now and the future it hopes to bring to the Bluegrass State.\n\nDespite the pandemic's global impact on travel, Louisville's airport is adding new airlines and destinations, upgrading its facilities, and promising a bright future as we all return to the skies to take in the world that's waiting for us. This tour covers each airside concourse and airline, including newly-arriving Spirit Airlines, which starts service in May 2021. This tour also highlights the important role UPS plays in the health and growth of the airport, and some of the on-site facilities and services you might use when you arrive.\n\nSDF's airport may seem humble and modest on the surface, but it functions as a major passenger destination as well as a critical node in worldwide shipping. Whether you're coming in to explore our city's exceptional bourbon and food scene, take in one of our heart-pumping sporting events, or visiting a friend, family member, or prospective school, you'll be impressed by SDF, and we'll hope to see you again soon!\n\nSpecial thanks to my wife Beth, who helped and herself obtained some of the footage in this video. No matter where we are, she's the best companion I could ever want!\n\nAirports are our gateway to the world, and I hope you enjoy this and other airport tour videos from Miles by Foot!\n\nThanks for watching, and keep moving forward!\n\n#airport #airporttour #kentuckyderby #louisville #sdf #ups #kentuckyoaks #aviation #travel\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:18 - Destinations\n00:37 - Renovations\n00:48 - Landside Departures\n01:26 - Airside Terminal\n01:40 - Concourse A (Delta, United, Frontier, Allegiant, Spirit)\n02:45 - Concourse B (Southwest, American)\n04:00 - UPS Worldport\n05:00 - Arriving at SDF\n06:25 - Conclusion\n06:45 - End Screen\n\n_________________________________\n\nGear \n\nGoPro Hero 7 Black\nNikon D3200\nCanon Vixia\n\nMusic - Colors of You - Dye O\n\nAircraft, flight information, and statistics from flightaware.com, flylouisville.com, spirit.com, UPS.com, and faa.gov.\n\nThis video is not endorsed or authorized by any of the public or private entities shown within.\n\nThis video is the sole property of Miles by Foot.

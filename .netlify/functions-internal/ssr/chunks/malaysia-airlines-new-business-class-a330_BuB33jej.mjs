Watch this review to find out.\n\nI flew with Malaysia Airlines in business class on their Airbus A330 aircraft from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur and return to Adelaide.  \n\nThis review covers the Qantas First Class lounge at Melbourne Airport, boarding, take off, the Malaysia Airlines business class seat and onboard dining - including the famous and delicious Malaysia Airlines satays.\n\nI show how the Malaysia Airline Business Class seat converts into a fully flat bed.  This flight review video covers 2 different seats 7A and 4K showing the difference between a window seat and one of the famous throne seats. \n\nI also cover the Malaysia Airlines inflight entertainment system and business class amenities kit.  \n\nOverall I found Malaysia Airlines business class to be very good and I'd have no hesitation flying them again. \n\nCheck out my channel DennisBunnik Travels for various other flight reviews including Emirates, Qantas, Qatar, Cathay Pacific, Turkish Airlines, Egypt Air and Air Baltic.",source:"youtube",source_id:"S8nDOOaW4p8",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1483669665000)};

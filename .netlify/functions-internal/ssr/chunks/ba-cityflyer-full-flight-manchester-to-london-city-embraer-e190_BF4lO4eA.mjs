We enter the terminal and make our way through security to the busy departure lounge.  Our flight is called for boarding and we make our way down to gate 144, where our aircraft has just arrived from Ibiza.  We board our flight, which is as usual almost empty this evening.  We are welcomed aboard and soon push back and make a beautiful departure on a clear summer's evening from runway 23R.\n\nEn-route we are served a complimentary full bar service and snacks, as we travel south in style on our almost empty flight.  We commence our descent over Essex, before turning over South London and making our approach and landing to runway 09.  We get some fantastic views over the City of London just as the sun sets in the northwest, and touch down on schedule before backtracking to the terminal.  \n\nWe disembark and head straight through the small terminal to the DLR station for our short train ride into the city.\n\n\nAirline: British Airways (BA CityFlyer)\nFlight: BA7311\nAircraft: Embraer 190 G-LCYL\nFrom: Manchester (MAN)\nTo: London (LCY)\nDeparture: 20:38\nArrival: 21:23\nFlight Time: 0:45\nSeat: 20A\n\nTIMELINE: \n\n0:00:06 Outside terminal at Manchester Airport.

We were treated to the delivery of WestJet's first widebody aircraft, our first AC Rouge 767, several charters from Korean Air, and our first ever Bombardier CS100. Along with that were new liveries from Condor and KLM, and numerous rare aircraft from RAF A330MRTTs to a Dubai Air Wing 747-400. Unfortunately, this year we also said goodbye to some aircraft that had served YYC for several years, namely the Kelowna Flightcraft DC-10 and the British Airways 767. This music video encompasses the many rare visitors with some regular traffic thrown in. Enjoy, and all the best in 2016!\n\nThanks for watching!

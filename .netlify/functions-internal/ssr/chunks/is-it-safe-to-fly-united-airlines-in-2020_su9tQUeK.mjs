No doubt about it. In this video about a flight I took in July 2020 with United Airlines, I’ll share some of what’s changed. \n\nThis video features the newest addition to the United Airlines fleet: The CRJ-550 on a route from my home airport Piedmont Triad International (GSO) to Chicago’s O’Hare International (ORD). This was my first flight in the air in 130 days, so the excitement was palpable. \n\nI was impressed with how clean this United Airlines CRJ-550 was. The flight, which took 90 minutes was one of my most memorable because of just how great the experience was. Although service was limited, the flight was still fantastic. Watch this video to get a complete sense of what it’s like flying United Airlines in 2020.\n\nMy first United CRJ-550 Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIvIPCoOwVM\n\nHere’s a link to the unedited take-off and landing footage: \nhttps://youtu.be/gwPdGL9xTZY\n\nHere’s a link to my friend’s Hand Sanitzer Brand (I receive no benefit from this link, just happens to be my buddy’s company!):\nhttps://www.northernsafety.com/Product/343825/AllShield-8-oz-Hand-Surface-Sanitizer\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttp://www.JebBrooksFlies.com \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nI’m on Twitter, too:\nhttps://twitter.com/jebbrooks\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/ \n\nMusic:\nBe Ourselves – Jay Varton\nAries – Dye O\nEscapism – Jonatan Mollberg\nOnthou – Ever So Blue",source:"youtube",source_id:"pXznseHGhQs",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1595077213000)};

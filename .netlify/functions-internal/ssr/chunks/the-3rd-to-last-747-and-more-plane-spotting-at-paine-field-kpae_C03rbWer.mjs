const data = {name:"THE 3RD-TO-LAST 747 and MORE! Plane Spotting at Paine Field (KPAE)",description:"Paine Field Airport in Everett, Washington, is home to Boeing's widebody aircraft plant, building the 747, 767, and 777 families of airliners.\n\n@BSiskaAviation and I went on a bit of a road trip down to the States last week, and naturally had to stop by one of my favourite airports to spot at. \n\nWe lucked out and managed to capture the third to last Boeing 747 performing its first flight, along with a few other widebodies going for test flights of their own! Enjoy these 20+ minutes of Paine Field action!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

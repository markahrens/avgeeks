By WestJet maintenance and customer service though, perhaps not so much.\n\nSo long, 767!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: WestJet Airlines (WJA/WS)\nAircraft: Boeing 767-338ER(WL)\nFlight Number: WS8962\nLivery: Revised (2015) \nEngines: 2x General Electric CF6-80\nRegistration: C-FOGT\nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Lake City (LCQ)\nCallsign: WESTJET 8962 heavy\nRunway used: 17R\nDate filmed: September 16th 2020\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song: \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2020\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

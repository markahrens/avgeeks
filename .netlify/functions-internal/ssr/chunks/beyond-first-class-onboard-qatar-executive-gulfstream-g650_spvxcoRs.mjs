Specifically I’ll be trying out Qatar Executive’s Gulfstream G650, along with their new private terminal and private airport. I’ll be meeting with Captain Husam Khalil, who will be walking me through all the different features of this $65 million dollar jet. Other highlights will be high tea in the jet, meeting Captain Rashid and trying out the bedroom onboard this incredible aircraft. \n\nI’m starting my journey in Doha today, specifically Hamad International airport, at the executive wing. This is a facility reserved for the most discerning, ultra high net worth individual.. which clearly I’m not! Let’s explore what it’s like to travel as the 0.1%, what’s on offer and what’s it actually like? This is not an ordinary trip report, so come with me on a very rare opportunity to experience the private world of Qatar Executive.\n\nThanks again to Qatar Airways for inviting me along on this experience of a lifetime.\n\nFollow my travel live on IG: http://instagram.com/will.luxurytravel/",source:"youtube",source_id:"V0v4MPHscUs",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1635111664000)};

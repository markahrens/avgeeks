const data = {name:"IBERIA A330-300 | BUSINESS CLASS | LONDON HEATHROW - MADRID",description:"My first Iberia trip report! In this video I'm taking an Airbus A330-300 between London Heathrow and Madrid Barajas. \n\nSeveral times a week, Iberia substitute one of the regular A320/321 aircraft with an A330 or A340 on the Heathrow-Madrid route. This is because of cargo demand, rather than passenger demand. \n\nAs a result, enjoy a rather empty A330 on this 2 hour trip down into central Spain. This was far from the best business class experience I'll ever have, but given the choice, I'd still pick the wide body over the little Airbus any day!\n\nI hope you like the video. \n\nSubscribe, and drop me a comment! I try to respond to as many as I can!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter, @pauls_trips\n\nSnapchat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"rQv-XEOqc44",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1475242554000)};

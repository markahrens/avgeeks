The service is operated by a Horizon Air Dash 8 Q400. It was absolutely freezing on this night so the outdoor boarding and deplaning was not welcome!\n\nThe report features all aspects of the flight (no lounge at OAK though...), some views of San Francisco and the Bay Area at nightfall, and a very turbulent landing in Portland.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video!\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nTwitter: @pauls_trips\n\nSnapChat: pauls_trips",source:"youtube",source_id:"mv6les5Gmjc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1464000579000)};

Misconnection\nCost to book: BMA-BRU-LON ¬£117.50 including seat selection \n\nThanks for finding my video and pressing play!\n\nThe first really big delay for a long time. Due to poor weather and storms in Europe, as well as some less than urgent dispatching at Stockholm Bromma, I was delayed by two hours here. This made me miss my flight to London - watch until the end to find out what happens...\n\nI‚Äôm disappointed the booked SJ100 didn‚Äôt make it to work this flight, but an RJ85 is a pretty good replacement! One of Britain‚Äôs last airliners, the RJ is a solid workhorse. I really like the unconventional four engine, high wing setup. \n\nA quick note - this is a CityJet aircraft operating for Brussels Airlines. So the crew and aircraft are CityJet but the food and service standard Brussels Airlines. Quite a common arrangement in Europe. In case you‚Äôre wondering about the Irish registration... CityJet are an Irish airline. üëçüèª\n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

WestJet 767-338ER(WL) [C-GOGN] Landing and Taxi at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"On August 27th, 2017, WestJet Flight 1 from Calgary to London-Gatwick returned to Calgary after about 2 hours of dumping/burning fuel due to what the pilots said was an unreliable airspeed indicator. This video starts off mid-transmission between WS1 and Calgary Arrival, includes the landing, taxi into the gate, and shutdown of C-GOGN, one of four WestJet 767s in the fleet, all with ATC included! The passengers were eventually transferred to another aircraft and finally left YYC 5 hours after their initial departure time.

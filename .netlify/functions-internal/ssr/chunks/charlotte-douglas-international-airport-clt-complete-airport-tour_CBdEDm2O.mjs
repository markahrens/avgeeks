const data = {name:"Charlotte Douglas International Airport - CLT - Complete Airport Tour",description:"Thanks for watching this complete airport tour of Charlotte Douglas International Airport!\n\nAs a lifelong traveler, I never get tired of the process of boarding a plane going somewhere new and exciting! Today, I'm visiting an airport I'd never seen before, but one that many travelers visit every time they travel.\n\nCharlotte Douglas International Airport, CLT, is one of American Airlines' primary domestic and regional hubs, providing service to hundreds of destinations around North America. It's the 10th busiest airport in the United States, providing connections for tens of thousands of passengers each day.\n\nThis tour covers each of Charlotte's five airside concourses as well as its central atrium, including each departure hall, directions to each, and practical tips and time to help you connect to your next flight. CLT's in the process of expanding and remodeling, and we'll look at the airport's future, too. For many visitors, Charlotte is just a stop on the way to their final destination, but I'll show you why it's a nice place to spend a few minutes or a few hours. Thanks for joining me on this tour!\n\nThis video was made independently, without implicit or explicit endorsement or support from any party mentioned or shown within the video, including the Charlotte Aviation Department, the city of Charlotte, any airline mentioned or shown within the video, or any third-party service provider shown or mentioned in the video.

So of course, I had to try it for myself. \n\nThis flight is, strictly speaking, all economy. You can't buy a business class ticket - Aer Lingus only sells business class on its American routes. But for a supplement on top of the fare to Malaga you can sit up front in the terrific business class seats Aer Lingus has. There are two very special seats in business class - like mine! They're solo \"throne\" seats on the right hand side of the aircraft with table space either side of the seat. \n\nAnyway, this is one of the best value flights you'll find in Europe - three hours on a widebody with a TV and bed. Nice!\n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

const data = {name:"Aer Lingus Full Flight | Birmingham to Cork |  ATR72-600 *With ATC*",description:"Full length, real time flight with Aer Lingus Regional (Stobart Air), onboard ATR72-600 EI-FCZ, operating flight EI3701 from Birmingham (BHX) to Cork (ORK) on 15 December 2014.  \n\n*Every minute of the flight included from gate to gate, and ATC from our entry into Irish airspace*\n\n***PLEASE SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, COMMENT, AND FOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, GOOGLE+ AND INSTAGRAM!!***\n\nThe video begins on the ground at Birmingham, before we push back and taxi out for departure from runway 33.  We make a left turn soon after takeoff, getting a great view of Birmingham city centre.  We then head towards Hereford, making a right turn to cross South Wales and cross the coast over Pembrokeshire.  A little cloud builds up but soon clears, offering us a fantastic view of Ireland's south coast on a beautiful morning.  We eventually make a right turn to cross the coast and are treated to a beautiful view of Ireland's countryside as we descend on the ILS for runway 35 at Cork.  We touchdown on schedule and taxi into the terminal building.\n\n*On the request of cabin crew, no video is included of boarding or inside the aircraft.  Sorry about that.*\n\nVideo taken from seat 4F.\n\nAirline:  Aer Lingus Regional (op by Stobart Air)\nFlight:  EI3701\nAircraft:  ATR72-600 EI-FCZ\nFrom:  Birmingham (BHX)\nTo:  Cork (ORK)\nDeparture:  08:43\nArrival:  10:06\nFlight Time:  01:23\nSeat:  4F\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/BHjMtH\n\nPlease enjoy the flight and feel free to subscribe/comment!\n\n***PLEASE SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, COMMENT, AND FOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER, GOOGLE+ AND INSTAGRAM!!***\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

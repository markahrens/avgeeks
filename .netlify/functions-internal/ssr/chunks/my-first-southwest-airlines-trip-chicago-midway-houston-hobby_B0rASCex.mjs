I first heard of Southwest as a young man watching syndications of Airline on British TV (incidentally, we invented that show, with Easyjet starring first..). \n\nI was pretty impressed by Southwest and liked their individual style. They have free drinks and snacks and you don't have to pay for your bag, either. But one thing annoyed me - open seating. That causes anxiety among family groups who can't be sure they'll sit together, and it was clear there were a lot of dubious preboards from people who probably didn't qualify. Anyway, this was a short trip from Midway in Chicago to William P Hobby airport in Houston, and it was cheap, on time, and an interesting experience. \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

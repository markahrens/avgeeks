const data = {name:"Uber in an airplane? It's possible TODAY!",description:"Yes, there are Ubers in the air right now!! Thanks to companies like Imagineair, you can easily take an Uber Airplane from one place to another. \n\nRecently, I needed to get from Washington, DC to Southwest Virginia in the USA to visit my Mom. So, let's test out an airborne Uber by taking one of these \"air taxis\" from Washington's Dulles International Airport to Tazewell, Va., USA (JFZ). 1.5 hours in a flying taxi (a/k/a a Cirrus SR22) sure beats an eight hour uber ride that would have been required if I'd stayed on the ground.\n\nThe video includes unmatched views of the Shenandoah Valley as well as some pretty interesting tidbits about flying air taxis around the East Coast of the United States. It was a pretty memorable flight for me and -- perhaps -- you'll enjoy joining me, too!?\n\nPlease like and comment on the video. I'd also really appreciate it if you'll subscribe to my channel!\n\nFollow my exploits on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to my channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nAlso, check out my Travel Blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic: \n\"In The Treehouse\" by Sebastian Forslund & \"Drift Apart\" by Anders Schill Paulsen",source:"youtube",source_id:"B4gIGQX9clw",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1514809867000)};

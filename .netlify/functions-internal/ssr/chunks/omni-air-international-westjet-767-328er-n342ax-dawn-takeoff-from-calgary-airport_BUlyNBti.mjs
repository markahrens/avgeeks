const data = {name:"Omni Air International (WestJet) 767-328ER [N342AX] Dawn Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Due to the 767 delays, WestJet was unable to get the ETOPS certification needed to fly to Hawaii in time. As a result, they needed to lease a pair of aircraft from another airline (ironically, the whole reason they bought widebodies in the first place). These two aircraft came from Omni Air International, A 767-200ER (which I will need to catch at some point) and a 767-300ER (featured in this video). Enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

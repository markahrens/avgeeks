const data = {name:"ENGINE ROAR! Air Canada Express CRJ-705 Onboard Takeoff from Washington, D.C.!",description:"Just listen to that engine buzz! Here we have my view on board Air Canada Express flight 8827 from Washington Ronald Reagan National Airport to Montreal-Trudeau International Airport filmed back in July, in the last row on the CRJ-705 (basically a CRJ900 but with fewer seats). Naturally, the last row on any T-tail aircraft has the best engine sound, and this was no exception!\n\nThis comprehensive departure video includes the aircraft taxiing into the gate on the inbound flight, the view from my seat of engine #1 starting up, and the taxi and powerful takeoff from DCA's runway 19, along with a flyover of Washington Dulles Airport at the end! Hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nVIDEO LOG: \n00:12 - My ride to YUL, C-FBJZ taxiing into Gate 3.\n01:05 - Engine #1 starting up.\n01:55 - Taxi begins.\n05:05 - Taxiing by United's Friendship A320, a Delta MD90, and DCA's classic main terminal!\n06:53 - Holding short runway 19.\n07:35 - Taxiing onto the runway and immediately spooling up.\n08:45 - Rotate!\n09:50 - Flaps up.\n14:00 - Flying over Washington Dulles (IAD)!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- \n\nFLIGHT INFO \nAirline: Air Canada Express - Jazz (JZA/QK) \nAircraft: Bombardier CRJ705 (CRJ9) \nAircraft Name: None \nLivery: Old (2005-2017) \nEngines: 2x GE CF34-8C5\nRegistration: C-FBJZ\nRoute: Washington Reagan National (DCA) - Montreal-Trudeau (YUL)\nCallsign: Jazz 8827 \nSeat: 28A\nRunway used: 19\nDate filmed: July 27, 2017 \nLocal time: 1600 \nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/CFBJZ \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dude8472productionsYT/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"AbblYq6zhMk",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1511921822000)};

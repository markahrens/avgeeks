Well, here it is! I travelled back from Prague to Birmingham on Jet2. This is a relatively new route for Jet2 as they branch out from more traditional Sun destinations to other leisure routes. \n\nOne of the things that I really appreciate when flying a new airline is when that airline lives up entirely to its marketing. I love it when an airline absolutely KNOWS, with total confidence, what its selling point is, what the reason for its existence is, and then delivers that experience to the paying customer. What I mean by that is, for example, I don‚Äôt actually know what British Airways promise any more. Are they budget? Are they a luxury carrier? Are they patriotic? I love it when you get an airline that knows what they are! Like Southwest (fun, efficient, warm), Cathay Pacific (aspirational, hospitable, luxury), or in this case Jet2 (cheesy, cheap, cheerful). Cheap and cheerful is absolutely fine with me! But you‚Äôd better make sure you are both a) cheap, and b) cheerful...\n\nOverall this was a very good value flight, and it goes to show that flying budget can be every bit as good as flying with a legacy airline. Jet2 are a really fun airline without being excessively irritating. This was shot a few weeks before Christmas and I was surprised to hear them playing proper Christmas pop songs on boarding (Mariah Carey, Wizzard and Jona Lewie being among the artists being played). Not sure how expensive the royalties are! However I‚Äôve had to cover the music up with some of my own so I don‚Äôt get a copyright strike. \n\nThis flight was full of people who had enjoyed a weekend in Prague, one of Europe‚Äôs top cities to have a weekend break in. There was a good atmosphere on board and the crew were excellent. Sitting at the front it was noticeable how hard they worked, as the service and upselling continued throughout the whole flight. Upselling on aircraft can be very irritating - those of you who know about Ryanair‚Äôs scratch cards or some carriers in the US rambling on about credit cards will know what I mean - but Jet2 managed to do pull this off without being too over the top. \n\nThe aircraft itself was brand new with a Boeing Sky interior - seats were excellent and mine had almost unlimited legroom (a bargain at ¬£16!). What a pleasure to fly on such a new bird. \n\nI was really surprised by Jet2 and I‚Äôm glad people recommended I take them, as they‚Äôre not an airline I‚Äôd normally keep on my ‚Äúradar‚Äù. \n\nMake sure you have your notifications set! üõé \n\nEnjoy the report. \n\nRAF Cardington Wikipedia page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Cardington\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports?

const data = {name:"Air Azores A310 Business Class",description:"Most business class flights from North America to Europe involve lie flat seats and fine dining. Many are even on the newest, flashiest airplanes in an airline's fleet. That's not the case with this flight from Boston to the Azores. Is this the worst business class to Europe? \n\nLet's check out a business class flight with Air Azores (a/k/a Azores Airlines a/k/a SATA) from Boston (BOS) to Ponta Delgada (PDL) on the island of SÃ£o Miguel on the archipelago of the Azores, which belong to Portugal. \n\nAir Azores (a/k/a Azores Airlines a/k/a SATA) offers one of the only business class cabins crossing the Atlantic without a lie flat seat.\n\nAs an \"AvGeek,\" I was excited about the 25 year-old Airbus A310 that served the route (CS-TGV), but it's probably not everyone's cup of tea. There aren't that many still left flying, so it promised to be very exciting!\n\nThe service, on the other hand, wasn't going to be. It began negatively when I got yelled at before I'd even boarded and ended with an ungracious goodbye. It's best described as \"unpolished.\" \n\nBut, what do you think?

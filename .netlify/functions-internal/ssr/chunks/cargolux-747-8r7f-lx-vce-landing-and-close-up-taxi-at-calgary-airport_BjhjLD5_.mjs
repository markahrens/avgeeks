const data = {name:"Cargolux 747-8R7F [LX-VCE] Landing and Close Up Taxi at Calgary Airport",description:"Another special daylight arrival from Cargolux! Here we have LX-VCE, a 5 year old 747-8F arriving on runway 35R and using up over 3/4 of our 14,000 foot runway to slow down. I was hoping it would take the taxiway just before, Delta 6, but to see it close up from an angle that's usually for departing aircraft was quite unique! Enjoy this gorgeous sunset arrival, with ATC (as usual!).\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: Cargolux Airlines Int'l (CLX/CV)\nAircraft: Boeing 747-8F (B748)\nAircraft Name: City of Echternach \nLivery: Stamdard\nEngines: 4x GEnx-2B67\nRegistration: LX-VCE\nRoute: Luxembourg-Findel (LUX) - Calgary (YYC)\nCallsign: Cargolux 772 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: June 5, 2016\nLocal time: 2100\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/LXVCE\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nÂ© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"kF-bHXrgKYE",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1496729087000)};

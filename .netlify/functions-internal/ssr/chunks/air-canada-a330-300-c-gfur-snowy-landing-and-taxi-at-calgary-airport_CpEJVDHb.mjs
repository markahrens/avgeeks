const data = {name:"Air Canada A330-300 [C-GFUR] Snowy Landing and Taxi at Calgary Airport",description:"Ever since the introduction of the 787-9 into Air Canada's fleet, their Airbus A330 has become a rare sight here in Calgary, with nearly all of the A330 routes being out of Toronto or Montreal. Nonetheless, Calgary was treated to roughly a week or so of domestic AC A330 service around the holidays in 2017. Here we have C-GFUR, a 17.5 (at the time of filming) year old A330 landing and taxiing up close, arriving from Toronto as AC143.

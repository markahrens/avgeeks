const data = {name:"TRANS-CANADA AIR LINES A220! Air Canada's New Retro Livery at Calgary Airport",description:"Thank you to RadarBox for supporting this plane spotting video! Find out more about them at https://www.radarbox.com/?referrer=AlexAviation\n\nIn February 2021, Air Canada unveiled a Trans-Canada Air Lines retro livery on one of their newest Airbus A220-300s.\n\nHaving retired the Airbus A319 that the livery was previously on in January, this came as a surprise to spotters across the country.\n\nThe \"new\" TCA paid Calgary a visit for the first time on April 6th, and it's since come back a few times, so I wanted to compile a few different angles of it before sharing.\n\nI absolutely love the way this looks on the A220! It's bound to be one of the most photographed Air Canada birds over the next decade or two!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Canada (ACA/AC)\nAircraft: Airbus A220-371 (BCS3)\nFlight Number: AC202 / 225 / 212\nLivery: Trans-Canada Air Lines Retro Livery\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney PW1500G\nRegistration: C-GNBN\nRoute: Vancouver (YVR) - Calgary (YYC) - Vancouver (YVR)\nCallsign: AIR CANADA 202 / 225 / 212\nRunway used: 35L / 17R /17R\nDate filmed: Various dates throughout April 2021\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\nÂ© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2021\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

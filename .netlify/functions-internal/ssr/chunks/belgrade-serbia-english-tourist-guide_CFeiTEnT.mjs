I've always been fascinated in the country, but known very little about it. We were only in Belgrade (the capital) for three days, so took full advantage of our time here. You'll see from the vlog we tried to fit in as much as possible, from partying, to shooting, to Serbian lessons and eating! \n\nHope you like it guys, it was a lot of fun to film, but do let me know if you have any suggestions for future vlogs, places, things to see and improvements are always welcome! \n\nA special thanks to Yana for helping us with our Serbian, showing us around and also introducing us to breakfast, Serbian style! \n\nTo try your best shout out this is the place we used: https://sktarget.rs/en/\n\nInstagram:\nPeter: @grimmo1990\nWill: @davis.travel\n\n\nMusic used:\n\nRunning by Dj Quads https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads\n\nAdventures by A Himitsu https://soundcloud.com/a-himitsu Creative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 Unportedâ€” CC BY 3.0\n\nSay Good Night by Joakim Karud https://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud Creative Commons â€” Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unportedâ€” CC BY-SA 3.0",source:"youtube",source_id:"BL7HQDkgMHY",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1537368585000)};

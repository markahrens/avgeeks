So we set off on an adventure, a quest, to the Middle of Nowhere in order to escape the day to day reality of running an international touring company while the world is in lockdown. \n\nJoin my brother Sacha and I as we take the ultimate road trip to the middle of nowhere. We travel from Adelaide, South Australia all the way to the Western Australian border.  To reach it we'd have to cross the mighty Nullarbor Plain - a 200,000sq km desert that rose from the ocean floor some 25 million years ago.  This unique part of the world can be seen from space but to get the full experience you need to get into your car and drive out there. \n\nOur adventure takes us along the Eyre Highway from Port Augusta through the Eyre Peninsular towards to the Great Australian Bight.  This epic road trip includes Kimba, Iron Knob, Streaky Bay, Smokey Bay, Ceduna, Penong, Fowlers Bay and the Head of the Bight where we got to see the majestic Southern Right Whales that call these waters home every winter. \n\nWe stay overnight at the famous Nullarbor Roadhouse which is the perfect spot for a bit of truck and roadtrain spotting.  From here it's only a short hop to the West Australian border with stops at the Bunda Cliffs along the way.  \n\nTo find the Middle of Nowhere we had to turn off from the main Eyre Highway and meander down the old dirt track that was the original road.  Here, a thousand miles away from anywhere and a million miles away from the pressures of work we find what we've been looking for.   \n\nIt was an epic journey and an absolute delight to share it with my brother. \n\n#roadtrip\n#nullarbor\n#roadtriptonowhere",source:"youtube",source_id:"NQjnqqaR8sM",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1628984439000)};

With such a big business class cabin, reward availability is always good! This flight is unmissable thanks to the fabulous business cabin, featuring a semi-private suite, flat bed and huge windows. This aircraft has definitely been a game changer for Finnair.\n\nJoin me for the whole trip – including the Premium Finnair Lounge at Helsinki, boarding, taxi, takeoff, breakfast, cruise and landing at a blustery and cold London Heathrow. \n\nI absolutely recommend Finland and Helsinki, especially if you can get there by A350 – I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nThat other A350 video I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot2GL4oniRs",source:"youtube",source_id:"r1JlwUP8qbU",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1478868740000)};

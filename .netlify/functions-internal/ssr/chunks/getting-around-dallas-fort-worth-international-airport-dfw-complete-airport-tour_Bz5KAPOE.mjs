const data = {name:"Getting Around Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) - Complete Airport Tour",description:"Thanks for joining me on this tour of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport! Today's tour covers the world's 4th busiest airport in 2020 and home to American Airlines. This mammoth airport personifies its state like no airport could, but even at such an incredible size, we still have to get around it! \n\nDallas Fort Worth's five terminals host hundreds of destinations for American Airlines and 27 other airlines, and connect tens of thousands of air travelers each and every day. Many of its international routes have also returned in the wake of the pandemic, making DFW a worldwide travel center once again.\n\nSee each and every terminal, how to get around, and where to find what you need during your time at DFW!\n\nI do a lot of original research while preparing these videos, so please leave a comment below if you have questions about the tour or navigating the airport, and I'll do my best to answer them!

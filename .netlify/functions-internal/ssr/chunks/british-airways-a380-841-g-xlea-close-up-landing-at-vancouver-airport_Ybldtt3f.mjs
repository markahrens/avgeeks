const data = {name:"British Airways A380-841 [G-XLEA] Close Up Landing at Vancouver Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"On May 1st, 2016, British Airways made history in being the first scheduled operator of the Airbus A380 to Vancouver International Airport. When I heard the news a couple months earlier, what was I supposed to do? Why, drive to Vancouver and see it, of course ;) Here we have \"Speedbird 5 Victor Yankee Super\" landing at YVR on runway 08L, with ATC and a bit of taxi footage. Sorry for the shaky bit at the beginning, it gets better (I promise). Enjoy my first ever catch of a BA A380!\n\nThanks for watching!\n____________________________________________________\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: British Airways (BAW/BA)\nAircraft: Airbus A380-800 (A388)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Revised with crest\nEngines: 4x RR Trent 900\nRegistration: G-XLEA\nRoute: LHR-YVR\nCallsign: Speedbird 5 Victor Yankee Super\nRunway used: 08L\nLocal Time: 1845\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/GXLEA\n____________________________________________________\n\nPrevious video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Nxskqp6EIo\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nGoogle Plus: https://www.google.com/+dude8472productions\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2016\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"EmRghyrigrg",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1463980296000)};

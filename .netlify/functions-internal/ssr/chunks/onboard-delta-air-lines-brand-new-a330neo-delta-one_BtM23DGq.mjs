const data = {name:"Onboard Delta Air Line's BRAND NEW A330neo Delta One",description:"I flew Delta One (Business Class) on Delta Air Lines' brand new Airbus A330neo. In this video, I showcase the Delta A330neo's seat, brand new inflight entertainment, incredible food, and everything else about this flight from Seattle to Shanghai.\n\nDelta's A330neo is new in many ways. Of course, the A330 offers incredible fuel savings, but Delta also used the aircraft as a way to introduce a new version of their Delta One Suite that accommodates the fact that the A330 has a more narrow airframe than the A350 or 777, which also have the Delta One Suites.\n\nI was also invited to participate in an event for the media celebrating Delta's A330neo! I got the chance to board the plane early, check out all of the cabins (Main Cabin, Comfort+, Premium Select, and Delta One). This video even highlights the best Economy Cabin seats on the Delta Air Lines A330neo.\n\nHere's a link to the full, unedited take-off and landing footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/GTao70Fxr3Y\n\nWant some Bose headphones?\nhttp://jeb.flights/bose\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksfl...\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nChoose: Mindme\nKilimanjaro: Luftmensch\nNow You Sale Away: OTE\nSlow It Down: Mindme",source:"youtube",source_id:"CHt-JPNtpkA",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1563462887000)};

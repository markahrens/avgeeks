const data = {name:"Lufthansa 747-8i Wet Takeoff from Paine Field ᴴᴰ",description:"Happy Heavy Aircraft Friday!\n\nHey everyone, this is Lufthansa's 9th Boeing 747-8i, D-ABYK, named \"Rheinland-Pfalz\", departing Paine Field on a short test flight. Another thing about Paine Field is that it rains quite frequently, which isn't great to stand outside in, but makes for some incredible shots once it stops. This bird was delivered about a week after I caught this video, and its first revenue flight with Lufthansa was LH456 to LAX on August 29. I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

We enter the terminal and head through security, and head to our gate.  It isn't long before our aircraft arrives, Airbus A320 D-AIUF.  We board our aircraft and before long we're pushing back and taxying to runway 19R.  We make a beautiful departure to the south, seeing a lot of Sweden's great scenery as we head towards the coast at Kristianstad, Sweden.  We make the short hop across the Baltic Sea to Germany, crossing the German coast near to Rostock.\n\nWe continue on our southwesterly heading towards Braunschweig, before commencing our descent towards Frankfurt.  We make our approach to runway 25L touching down smoothly and on time.  The captain announces that we have to park on a non-Schengen stand, therefore we will have to get a bus from there to the Schengen part of the airport.  We leave the aircraft via the rear stairs and board the bus, which takes us across the airport getting up close to a lot of parked aircraft.  We enter the terminal and head towards flight connections.  \n\nTIMELINE\n\n00:00:06  Outside Stockholm Arlanda T5, Walking into terminal, walking to security\n00:02:37  After security, walking to gate\n00:07:57  Gate area\n00:08:30  Our aircraft pulling onto the stand\n00:10:20  Boarding the aircraft and taking our seat in seat 21A\n00:17:53  Pushback, engine start\n00:21:49  Taxi to runway 19R\n00:28:08  Line up on runway 19R, takeoff\n01:03:06  Kristianstad, Sweden\n01:05:39  Meal service - sandwich with beer (Warsteiner)\n01:12:27  Jasmund, Germany\n01:16:44  Ribnitz, Germany\n01:24:46  Cabin View\n01:56:05  Final approach to runway 25L at Frankfurt, Obertshausen, Germany\n02:00:00  Landing on runway 25L\n02:06:25  Pulling onto stand B27\n02:09:09  Disembarking through rear stairs, boarding bus to Schengen area of airport\n02:12:41  Bus ride to terminal\n02:15:38  Walking into terminal, heading to flight connections\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"JNDkUI29Kdw",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1501851626000)};

const data = {name:"Spotting From the Parking Garage | Calgary International Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Hey everyone, today's video is a bit different from my usual ones, and it features several aircraft from a different spot! I was out recently looking for a new spot, and discovered this one - the top level of the parking garage at Calgary International Airport! As you can see in the video, the spot has a pretty spectacular view of operations at Concourse D, as well as approaches and touchdowns on Runway 16. The only downside to it is that it costs 10 bucks an hour to park there :/ \n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe! More videos are coming soon.\n_____________________________________________________\n\n© dude8472productions 2013\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"MOht0sGQiR8",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1381123489000)};

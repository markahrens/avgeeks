const data = {name:"Ryanair Full Flight | Carcassonne to East Midlands | Boeing 737-800 (with ATC)",description:"A full length full flight video in real time from Carcassonne (CCF) to East Midlands (EMA) onboard Ryanair Boeing 737-800 EI-FOW, operating flight FR1613 on Friday June 3 2016.\n\nOur journey begins outside the small airport at Carcassonne, France.  We walk into the tiny terminal, which today has only three departures - all with Ryanair - to Brussels Charleroi, Manchester and our flight to East Midlands.  We go through the small security checkpoint to the departure lounge, which consists of a few rows of seating and a vending machine!\n\nAfter some time our aircraft arrives after her inbound flight from East Midlands.  Today's aircraft is an almost new Boeing 737-800, EI-FOW.  There is a short delay until boarding commences, and we walk out in the warm sunshine to our waiting aircraft.  On arrival at the airport, a fire truck is in attendance.  We later find out that a passenger had collapsed on the inbound flight and the fire truck was to assist the passenger off the aircraft, this is also the reason for our short delay in boarding.\n\nEventually the ill passenger is carried off the aircraft and we are able to continue boarding, taking our seat in 3F.  Before long we receive our departure clearance from Carcassonne Tower, and we get our clearance to start the engines and taxi.  We depart from runway 28 at Carcassonne climbing towards Toulouse, contacting Toulouse Approach shortly after departure.  We continue our climb getting a great view of the south of France as we contact Bordeaux control and climb to FL380.  Our route today takes us towards La Rochelle, and then turning right on a northerly heading towards Cherbourg, where we cross the coast to the English Channel.\n\nWe are handed off from Brest to London control, and cross the English coast to the east of Portsmouth.  We head towards London and begin our descent towards East Midlands, being handed off to East Midlands radar as we descend.  We are then vectored towards an ILS approach on runway 09, which takes us towards Burton on Trent and back towards East Midlands.  We pass overhead Donington racetrack, where a race is underway, before touching down smoothly on runway 09.  We exit the runway and contact ground, who clear us to taxi to the stand.\n\nWe disembark the aircraft through the forward door and walk into the terminal, clearing immigration quickly but then as usual for East Midlands, having to wait for a long time before the bags come through to the carousel.  We walk through customs and to the street.\n\nKey moments in flight: \n0:00:03  Outside the airport at Carcassonne\n0:00:32  Walking into the terminal\n0:01:46  Security\n0:01:50  Departure lounge\n0:02:06  Ryanair flight to Brussels/Charleroi departs\n0:04:11  Boarding announced\n0:05:31  Commencing boarding\n0:08:21  Walking out to aircraft\n0:10:18  Waiting at side of aircraft for ill passenger to be carried off\n0:12:20  Boarding through the front steps, taking seat 3F\n0:28:32  Captain welcomes us onboard and explains the reason for the delay and about the sick passenger\n0:29:33  Captain calls the tower to ask what time the flight plan is valid until\n0:32:25  Tower tries several times to call the flight deck but they don't answer\n0:34:00  Flight deck requests engine start\n0:37:53  Tower calls flight deck to ask if we are ready to taxi, we get taxi clearance and taxi to runway 28.

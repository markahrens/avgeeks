const data = {name:"Delta Surplus Sale",description:"Every second Friday of the month, Aviation Enthusiasts descend on a shed next door to the Delta Flight Museum in Atlanta, Georgia. There, they comb through piles of aviation-related goodies. Everything from new blankets to old plates, it's all here. Perhaps nothing's more impressive than the airplane seats, though. I picked up some of my own. I also got a bunch of other cool stuff we'll check out. \n\nThis video also features an interview with Judy Bean who manages the Delta Surplus sale. She'll give you the ins-and-outs and will explain how you can take advantage of this interesting quirk of Delta Air Lines. You'll also find out how the Delta Surplus Sale benefits the Delta Flight Museum. \n\nCheck out Will's Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZu-0_ptx2iWqtAU6F-Q8Ug\n\nSponsorship Policy:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/sponsorship-policy\n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies \n\nCheck me out on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog: \nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic:\nLaguna - Raccy\nLion Heart - Raccy",source:"youtube",source_id:"e-1-FTwUSSw",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1575128050000)};

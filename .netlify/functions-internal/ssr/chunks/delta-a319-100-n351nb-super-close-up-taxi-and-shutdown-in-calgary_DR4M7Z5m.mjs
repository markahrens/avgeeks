const data = {name:"Delta A319-100 [N351NB] SUPER CLOSE UP Taxi and Shutdown in Calgary ᴴᴰ",description:"When I saw this Delta A319 taxiing really close up to me, I certainly didn't expect for it to turn straight towards me and park 7 feet away O_o As you can see in the video, I couldn't fit the whole thing in the frame, even when I was fully zoomed out... CRAZY! It's at about 1:00 in the video that I'm thinking: \"WHAT THE HECK IS THIS GUY DOING!?\" Lol... Apologies for the lousy focus in some parts of the video... I didn't have it configured to zoom out this much :P\n\nThanks for watching!

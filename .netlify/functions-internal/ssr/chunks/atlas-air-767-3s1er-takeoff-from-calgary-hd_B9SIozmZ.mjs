This bird was pretty heavily loaded for the transatlantic trip to Germany. This is another one of those RAF charters that come to Calgary every year, and the charters are almost always some interesting airlines like Atlas Air and Omni Air International which are pretty cool to see.\n\nThanks for watching, please comment, rate, and subscribe!

I’m also approaching ONE MILLION VIEWS of the channel, and this is only possible because you subscribe and give my videos exposure.\n\nYou’ve probably got used to my format. Now I’m sitting on a new year, 5k subs and ~1m views, I’m turning the channel up a notch. \n\nNew titles, a different editing style, more detail about the technical and logistical aspects of the flight, a new closing screen, and of course you get to see my face (not sure if that is an improvement, but I’m sure you will all leave feedback!). I’ll also be posting every Friday and Sunday where possible, and I aim to complete at least 50 more videos this year, doubling the size of the channel!\n\nOnto the report itself – follow me as I take a KLM 737-900 between London Heathrow Terminal 4 and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. I’m a brand new Flying Blue member – and I intend to build up to Elite status this year – but I managed to access the SkyTeam Lounge at T4 thanks to an old Alitalia Freccia Alata Plus status match (which expires in March). \n\nEnjoy a fine takeoff from Runway 27R, a brief tour of some of southern England’s aerodromes from the air, some inflight service, food and beverage highlights, as well as a beautifully smooth landing into Schiphol.\n\nThis was actually my first time with KLM, and I hope you liked the video as much as I liked the trip. \n\n\nMY MOST-WATCHED VIDEO - BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS 787 REPORT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LRFyTtxlRg \n\nTHE LAST TIME I WAS IN AMSTERDAM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3IoyWGhoaM \n\n\n#paulstripreports #vlog #review #flying #travel #aviation #avgeek\n\nMUSIC: Follow Floppy Circus » https://soundcloud.com/floppycircus\n\n***DON’T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!***",source:"youtube",source_id:"A7czvtEcP8I",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1485722231000)};

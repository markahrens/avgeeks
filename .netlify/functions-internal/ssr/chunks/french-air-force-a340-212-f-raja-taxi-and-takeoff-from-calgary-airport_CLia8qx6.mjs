const data = {name:"French Air Force A340-212 [F-RAJA] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"On July 6th, we received three surprise military visitors from Germany, Spain, and France, bringing troops and equipment for NATO training at CFB Suffield, a Canadian Forces Base southeast of Calgary. This occurs every year, with it comes some interesting military visitors! As you all saw in yesterday's video, the Germans brought an A400M, while the French brought an A340-200 and the Spanish brought a C-130. The French and Spanish both left today (after some substantial waiting on my part), and the C-130 video will come in a few days. For now, enjoy this incredibly special catch of one of 10 remaining Airbus A340-200s flying today! I'm very happy to have caught this, as this video essentially completes the A340 family on my channel. ATC is included, I hope you enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: French Air Force / Armée de l'Air (CTM)\nAircraft: Airbus A340-200 (A342)\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 4x CFMI CFM56-5C2 \nRegistration: F-RAJA \nRoute: Calgary (YYC) - Paris Charles De Gaulle (CDG)\nCallsign: COTAM 1014 heavy\nRunway used: 35R\nDate filmed: July 8, 2017\nLocal time: 1430\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"wmliCck98OI",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1499567966000)};

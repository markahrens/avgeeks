Here we have one of two German Air Force Airbus A340s departing Calgary International Airport, bound for Vancouver. Apparently, the German Defense Minister was in Calgary the past few days and brought an A340 with him. 340s are a rare breed at YYC, the last one being over a year ago, so I was very happy to have caught this departing. Pity it rotated so early.

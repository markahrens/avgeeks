const data = {name:"Kelowna Flightcraft DC-10-30F [C-GKFT] Landing and Taxi at Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"C-GKFT, 39.3 years old and still going strong! Here is one of Flightcraft's 4 DC-10s arriving at Calgary International Airport from Hamilton, Ontario. The landing footage isn't my best, it's pretty shaky, but the close up taxiing is pretty darn awesome! Just listen to the pilots spooling up the engines at 1:51! Whether they did it because they saw me or just to gain some speed, I don't know. Sadly, daylight savings time has messed with spotting times and this bird now arrives when there's no light at all :/ That's not going to stop me from getting it over the winter though! Sure hope KF will find somewhere to use these classics once the Purolator contract is done...\n\nFor any simmers watching this video, check out these new textures for the KF DC-10 fleet that I made: http://library.avsim.net/search.php?SearchTerm=Kelowna+Flightcraft+DC-10-30F+Fleet+Textures+Package&CatID=root&Go=Search\n\nThanks for watching!

Check out his awesome channel here: www.youtube.com/AviationNLNZ\nHey everyone, this is an overhead shot of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Airbus A330-300 landing at Calgary International Airport, arriving from Amsterdam Schiphol. I know I kind of messed up on the panning as he went over me, but I hope you'll still enjoy it!\n\nRandom fact! On October 17, Calgary Airport changed the runway numbers of runway 34/16 to 35L/17R, because of the Earth's magnetic poles slowly shifting over time. The \"L\" and \"R\" are because this runway will be parallel to a new one that's opening in 2014. They've also changed runway 28/10 and runway 7/25 into 29/11 and 8/26, respectively. This concludes my random fact.\n\nThanks for watching!

What's more, I'll have the entire cabin to myself for 14 hours. As always with my trip reports, I'll share with you all elements of the experience from the luxurious bed, Japanese tasting menu, caviar and various premium amenities. \n\nStarting in Chicago, my flight will cross the international date line, meaning technically I will be onboard for two days before arriving into Tokyo's Narita Airport. Given I've recently travelled onboard Singapore Airlines First Class, as well as ANA First Suites (both on their Boeing 777-300ER) I feel this review will be an interesting point of comparison between key luxury airline products in the Asian region. Have you flown JAL before, and if so what was your flight like?\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:05 The Lounge\n3:05 Getting Onboard\n6:00 Suite Tour\n6:38 Food Service\n10:19 The bed \n10:54 Day Two\n12:17 Parting Gifts \n13:13 Japan",source:"youtube",source_id:"7Cp0O4FFJUc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1650218403000)};

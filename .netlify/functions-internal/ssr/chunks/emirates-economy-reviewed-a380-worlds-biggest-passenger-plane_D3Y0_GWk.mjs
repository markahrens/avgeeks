const data = {name:"Emirates Economy Reviewed - A380 World's Biggest Passenger Plane",description:"Emirates Airlines is one of the world’s largest airlines and pre-pandemic it was flying close to 60million passengers per year through its mega-hub in Dubai.  The vast majority of those in economy class. \n\nBut how good are they in this post-pandemic era?  Join me on Emirates Economy Reviewed as I test and review Emirates Economy class from Dubai to Cairo on the A380 – the world’s biggest passenger plane. \n\nMy flight, EK927 is the morning service from Dubai to Cairo Egypt and takes about 3½  hours. Plenty of time to test out one of the almost 400 economy class seats on the Emirates A380.  \n\nAfter take-off from Dubai breakfast is served. \n\nThen it was time to sit back, relax and enjoy the Emirates ICE inflight entertainment system which is considered the very best in the world. \n\nThis Emirates Economy flight review covers every aspect of my flight on the Emirates A380 in economy class.  This includes boarding at Dubai International Airport, the take off, the inflight service, the seat, the meal and even the views out the window as we fly across Saudi Arabia on our way to Egypt. \n\nJoin me, let’s fly together. \n\nCheers\n\nDennis\n\nLinks to other videos mentioned:\nEmirates NEW Premium Economy Class: https://youtu.be/hznnSFAX8aM\n\nOther videos to check out:\nEmirates First Class: https://youtu.be/ulgxwkG87Fs\nEmirates Business Class including the A380 Bar: https://youtu.be/ril53LIn5eI\nAir France First Class:  https://youtu.be/OE5R5Cj7_Jo\n\n#emirates #emiratesflightreview #EmiratesA380\n\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:23 Boarding\n01:12 Economy Class Cabin\n02:03 Take off\n02:43 The Seat\n03:29 Inflight Meal\n04:09 ICE Inflight Entertainment System\n04:52 Window Views\n05:27 Approach & Landing into Cairo",source:"youtube",source_id:"xDW0nJtWbk0",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1672560018000)};

In this video, I take a trip down to Gran Canaria, to Las Palmas - an airport I have never visited before. \n\nDespite some irritating turbulence for a whole hour after the meal service, this was a pleasant flight. Service was prompt and the lunch served on board was tasty (even if it did look very bland!). One of the great things about transiting Madrid with Iberia is the chance to use their fine Terminal 4 lounges. These include shower rooms which are an absolute godsend when you‚Äôre tired and need to feel human again. \n\nOverall, a good flight and to be quite honest my experiences with the Express arm of Iberia have been better than those with ‚Äúmainline‚Äù Iberia. I was also very pleasantly surprised to find similar inflight entertainment delivered to my phone as was offered on my recent Easyjet journey to Geneva. This is definitely the future on short haul. \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

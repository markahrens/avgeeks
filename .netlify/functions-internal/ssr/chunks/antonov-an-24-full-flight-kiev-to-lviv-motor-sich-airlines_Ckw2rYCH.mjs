We walk to the domestic Terminal A and check in, before heading to the small gate area.  Before long we board a bus to our aircraft which is waiting on a remote stand.\n\nWe board this vintage aircraft, which was built almost 50 years ago in 1970.  The doors are soon closed and our engines are started by a vehicle based ground power unit (GPU) with a lot of smoke.  We soon commence our taxi to runway 26 at Kiev, and make a lumbering, smokey departure over the western suburbs of Kiev.  We climb above the clouds and get a good chance to investigate the entire cabin of this wonderful classic airliner.\n\nWe're served a cold lunch and coffee, and after a flight that goes very quickly we're soon descending into the Lviv area on a beautiful sunny winter day.  We make a smooth as butter touchdown on runway 31 at Lviv, and park up before getting another bus to the modern terminal building, and walking through the terminal to the kerbside.\n\nTIMELINE\n\n0:00:05 Outside Kiev Zhuliany Airport\n0:00:14 Antonov AN-24 Gate Guard\n0:00:26 Walking towards terminal buildings\n0:01:19 Walking to Terminal A (domestic terminal)\n0:02:16 Check in area at Terminal A\n0:02:32 Departure lounge at Terminal A\n0:02:59 Departure gate\n0:03:13 Overview of ramp at Zhuliany - note the military ramp in the distance\n0:03:42 Â£0.68p cup of coffee\n0:03:46 Bus ride to aircraft\n0:06:38 Boarding our aircraft, taking seat in 10D\n0:07:26 Cabin view during boarding\n0:08:15 Safety announcement\n0:09:04 Engine start using vehicle based GPU\n0:11:42 Start of taxi\n0:16:30 Line up on runway 26\n0:16:45 Take off on runway 26\n0:25:41 Cabin view of overhead console\n0:29:01 Window configuration on this aircraft\n0:30:46 Overhead console\n0:32:49 Seat detail\n0:34:13 Cabin view: lunch service\n0:34:55 Lunch: cheese and salami on a dry roll\n0:35:48 Table operation\n0:36:08 Cabin view: hot drink service\n0:36:44 Hot drinks service\n0:38:33 Washroom at rear of cabin\n0:39:35 Rear galley area, steps and door\n0:42:51 Captain goes to rear of cabin to talk to flight attendant\n0:45:26 Cabin views\n0:48:05 Safety card\n0:51:46 Inflight magazine\n0:55:13 Clouds clear leaving great views for the rest of the journey\n0:58:25 Cabin views\n1:03:15 Cabin detail\n1:08:28 Emergency exit\n1:13:26 Cabin view\n01:17:28 Cabin detail\n01:23:36 Cabin view\n01:29:59 Engine detail\n01:33:21 Seat view\n01:33:55 Top of descent into Lviv\n01:39:32 Turning onto final approach at Lviv\n01:40:19 Landing gear extended\n01:42:34 Landing on runway 31 at Lviv, taxi to ramp\n01:48:01 Disembarking through rear door to bus\n01:49:48 Bus ride to terminal\n01:53:01 Walking into terminal, and out to street\n#inflightVideo #FullFlight #FullFlightVideo",source:"youtube",source_id:"eDPW_eFv1jc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1519999187000)};

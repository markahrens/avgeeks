const data = {name:"FIRST VISIT! WestJet NEW LIVERY 737-700 at Calgary Airport! (4K)",description:"Over the past few weeks, WestJet has finally painted the first Boeing 737-700 in their new livery! Tail 225, C-GWJO, is also the first passenger 737NG to be repainted. It flew from Jacksonville, Florida to Toronto on September 25th, and then came to Calgary the next day.\n\nAt this point, it's been well over 5 years since their new branding was unveiled, so this is genuinely really nice to see. That extended timeline was not necessarily all on WestJet though, since they had the MAX grounding and then 2020 basically back to back.\n\nSupposedly though, painting will finally be ramping up over the next few months, and I cannot wait to see more 737NGs flying around in this livery. Enjoy this great-looking -700 on its first visit to Calgary with the new paint!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

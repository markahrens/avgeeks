const data = {name:"Qatar Airways Cargo 777-FDZ [A7-BFC] Landing and Parked at Calgary Airport",description:"This was quite a shock to see descending into YYC on FlightRadar24! Here we have one of Qatar Airways' eight 777 Freighters arriving on runway 35L at Calgary Airport, inbound from Amsterdam. According to several sources, it was carrying horses for the Spruce Meadows National tournament. Any kind of Middle Eastern registered aircraft is rarely seen in Calgary, so I'm quite happy I managed to get this bird! Sorry for all the shakiness on the landing, I'm not too proud of that part. Anyway, the video features ATC on the approach, the arrival itself, and the aircraft parked on Apron IX. Enjoy!\n\nThanks for watching!

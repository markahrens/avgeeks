Let me tell you why. \n\n1. A flatbed crossing the USA is a minimum requirement, but to have a closing suite is next level.\n2. Superb, motivated service by the crew. You know how you can tell from the first minute that a flight is going to be great? That. \n3. Clever meal idea with tapas style three-plate dinner.\n4. Most thoughtful and useful amenity kit I've seen in any class on any airline. Screen wipe? Smart. \n5. They serve a proper pre departure drink. \n6. Straightforward, unfussy product that speaks for itself. \n7. PRICE! This was $399 one way. That's about HALF the price of other flat bed transcons. I'm converted. \n\nOnly downsides are no alliance interlink and no lounge but those are overwhelmingly outweighed by the above. \n\nWatch the video and see for yourself. \n\nDo you have any ideas for future trip reports? Something you've never seen on YouTube before? Why not suggest it to me in the comments? I read every single one! üëçüèª\n\nEnjoy the video, and thanks for watching.

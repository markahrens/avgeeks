We soon start up our engines, and immediately head for the deicing bay where we are de-iced.  Then we continue our taxi to runway 22R, making a sporty takeoff to the south.  We climb to our cruising altitude of 25,000ft for our short cruise across the Baltic Sea to the German coast, after which we descend through the clouds towards Berlin, where it is again overcast.  We make our approach to runway 26R, touching down a few minutes ahead of schedule.\n\nVideo taken from seat 12A.\n\nAirline:  SAS Scandinavian Airlines (Cimber Air)\nFlight:  SK679\nAircraft:  Bombardier CRJ200 OY-RJK\nFrom:  Copenhagen (CPH)\nTo:  Berlin Tegel (TXL)\nDeparture:  14:40\nArrival:  15:30\nFlight Time:  00:50\nSeat:  12A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/xJRI6o\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

const data = {name:"PLANE SPOTTING NEXT TO THE RUNWAY! Calgary Airport Runway 35L",description:"About two weeks ago, Lynx Air took delivery of their first Boeing 737 MAX, and they arranged with the Calgary Airport Authority to have me film the arrival airside next to the runway!\n\nThis was such an amazing opportunity that I'm so grateful for and while I was out there I naturally had to film some of the regular traffic before Lynx arrived.\n\nOnce again, thank you so so much to the folks at YYC for their help and generosity that day, and I hope you enjoy this very different spotting perspective!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

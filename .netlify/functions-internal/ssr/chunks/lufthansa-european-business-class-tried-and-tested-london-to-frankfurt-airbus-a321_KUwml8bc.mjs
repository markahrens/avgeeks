Probably. Known for Teutonic efficiency and delivering a solid basic product, Lufthansa rarely sparkle on short haul. \n\nIn this trip I travel between London Heathrow and Frankfurt am Main using Lufthansa‚Äôs A321, a staple of their short haul fleet. I know a lot of people criticise European business classes solely because of the seat (economy ones with blocked centre seats in each row), but don‚Äôt let that be the end of your analysis. \n\nLufthansa‚Äôs lounge at Heathrow T2 is a good effort. It had a decent cooked breakfast and plenty of places to sit. Sure, it lacks in ambience, and is pretty dull...but t gets the job done. \n\nGetting the job done is pretty much Lufthansa‚Äôs approach on short haul. There‚Äôs little to actually complain about - other than onboard food - but also nothing to rave about either. Much as I like to moan about British Airways, on their Frankfurt flights they‚Äôll bother with a hot breakfast served onboard. Lufthansa served me a rather poor cold option. They could do a lot better than that. \n\nHowever, the flight was punctual, the legroom was decent for short haul, and I appreciated the efficiency Lufthansa offered. \n\nThe service lacked the panache and ‚Äúextra mile‚Äù offered by their Star Alliance cousins LOT Polish Airlines, which was excellent when I flew with them at the start of the year. \n\nIf you want to find out more about my future plans and join in conversations I have about travel, follow me on Twitter: @pauls_trips.

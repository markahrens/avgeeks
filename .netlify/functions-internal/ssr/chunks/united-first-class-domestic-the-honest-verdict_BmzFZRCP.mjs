const data = {name:"United First Class Domestic: The Honest Verdict",description:"So how does United Airlines First Class compare?  Join me as I fly United First on one of their Airbus A319 aircraft from San Francisco to Seattle and we'll find out.  \n\nThis is United First - which is the equivalent to business class elsewhere in the world. So how does United First compare to business class with Qantas in Australia or with other full service airlines in Europe?  Very well in some areas and very poorly in others.\n\nOn this United Airlines Flight Review I give you the honest verdict on United First Class Domestic service ranging from the airport experience through to boarding, pre-departure drink, the seat, the service, inflight catering and inflight entertainment system.  \n\nThis flight was filmed in early July 2022 and was a connecting flight included in my Air New Zealand long haul business class ticket. \n\nLinks to other reviews mentioned:\n\nAir New Zealand Business Class Part 1:  https://youtu.be/GE3T5eA89YY\nAir New Zealand Business Class Part 2:  https://youtu.be/AUc88_aYFk8\nUnited Airlines old 777 First Class to Hawaii: https://youtu.be/1Gbs4BQog6M\n\n#unitedfirst #unitedairlines #flightreview\n00:00 Introduction\n01:14 Plane Spotting\n02:00 Boarding\n02:44 Take Off\n03:19 The Seats\n04:23 Inflight Entertainment\n05:03 Meal\n05:34 Landing\n06:28 The Verdict",source:"youtube",source_id:"Ji8djo4oCSw",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1663486201000)};

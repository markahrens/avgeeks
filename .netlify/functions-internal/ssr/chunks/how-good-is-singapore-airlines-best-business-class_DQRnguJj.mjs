I flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne to find out. \n\nThis flight was on an A350 and features Singapore Airlines long-haul business class seat.  This is their flagship business class product. \n\nOur flight departed early evening and flew overnight so I got the chance to indulge in the full Singapore Airlines business class experience including dinner and trying out their lie flat business class bed.  \n\nSingapore Airlines is rated as one of the world's best airlines with award winning inflight service.  This flight was no exception with a wonderful crew and excellent food and drink offerings.  But what is the seat like?

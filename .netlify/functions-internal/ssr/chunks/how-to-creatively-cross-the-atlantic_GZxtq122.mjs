We'll check out the lounges, the cabin, the food, and the views.\n\nI had been in Brussels following my incredible flight to and from Dubai with Emirates in their new 777 and needed a new way to get back across the Atlantic. As I scanned Google Flights, a great idea appeared: Royal Air Maroc! I'd never flown this airline and they offered a 787 flight from Casablanca, so I jumped at the chance.\n\nThe night before, I'd flown in from Brussels with Royal Air Maroc (RAM) and after a quick sleep and some sightseeing, I was ready to head back to the United States. I was very excited to jump onboard one of their Boeing 787 Dreamliners! Take a look at RAM's service and let me know what you think!\n\nTake a look at this report about the second leg (CMN - IAD) and let me know what you think!\n\nHere's a link to the first trip report (BRU - CMN)\nhttps://youtu.be/wao8p9U4SjU\n\nHere's a link to my review of Emirates' NEW FIRST CLASS cabin:\nhttps://youtu.be/AsswlMIo4vY \n\nFor more trip reports, please subscribe to my channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nMusic: \nScorpion Dance 2 - Håkan Eriksson\nArabian Nights 6 - Magnus Ringblom\nMinimalistic Acoustics 7 - Örjan Karlsson\nSudden Fun 9 - Johan Hynynen",source:"youtube",source_id:"ao8iFl_HS6A",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1520602601000)};

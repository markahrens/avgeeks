I frequently travel from Atlanta to Phoenix for work. These flights are usually on Delta 737's or 757's. I figured this experience wouldn't be any different. So much so, in fact, that I didn't even bring the camera I use to shoot trip reports (this video is shot entirely using my iPhone X). \n\nWhen I looked at the plane, though, a Delta 767-300ER (N178DN) was waiting. It had just come in from Santiago, Chile. That meant it was configured with Delta's International Business Class product, \"Delta One.\" I was excited to see how Delta does international business class...domestically on a 767!\n\nThe 767 Delta One seat has been nicknamed the \"flying coffin\" because many people find it confining. I didn't. In fact, it was a spectacular way to travel most of the way across the continent! Sure, it wasn't perfect, but check out the video to see what \"Delta One\" is like on a 767.\n\nLet me know in the comments what you think of the Delta 767!\n\nPlease subscribe to the channel!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jebbrooksflies\n\nCheck me out on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jebbrooks/\n\nAnd don't forget to take a look at my travel blog:\nhttps://greenergrass.com/\n\nThanks!",source:"youtube",source_id:"GMiq5b63Y6k",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1515854991000)};

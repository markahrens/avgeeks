const data = {name:"The BEST of 2023! Plane Spotting HIGHLIGHTS at YYC, YEG, and MORE! (4K)",description:"2023 was quite a year for the aviation industry, with lots of new developments, and of course, plenty of interesting planes to see.\n\nCalgary International Airport was no exception, welcoming several new destinations, and a few unique visitors too. At the end of each year, I usually put together a little \"best of\" video highlighting those special visitors.\n\nThis year though, I thought I would open it up to all of the airports I'd been to in 2023, which in many cases, were just for these planes. My personal favourites are probably Air Greenland's A330 in Fort McMurray and NASA's DC-8 at Paine Field.\n\nSo, without further ado, please enjoy my highlights for plane spotting on this channel in 2023.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

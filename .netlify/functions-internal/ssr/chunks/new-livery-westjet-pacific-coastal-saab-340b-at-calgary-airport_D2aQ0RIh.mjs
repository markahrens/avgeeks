const data = {name:"NEW LIVERY! WestJet (Pacific Coastal) Saab 340B at Calgary Airport",description:"Almost 5 years after WestJet’s new livery was unveiled, the very first Saab 340 has finally been painted!\n\nThis 29-year old turboprop, operated by Pacific Coastal on behalf of WestJet, had been in the States for some heavy maintenance since September, and flew back to Canada last week. It ferried from Vancouver to Calgary on Tuesday, and then went for a training flight the same day.\n\nNow, the new WestJet livery has been around for a while on the 737 MAXs, 787s, and WestJet Cargos, but this Saab is actually the very first plane to be painted that wasn’t a new addition to the fleet. In fairness to WestJet, the rebranding came at kind of an unlucky time for them in mid-2018. \n\nThe 737 MAX grounding a few months later meant they needed every plane they had available (so no time for painting), and then the financial situation from 2020 onwards.\n\nThat being said, they have yet to repaint a single 737NG or Dash 8, but now that the first repaint has finally taken place, here’s hoping the rest of the fleet will follow shortly! Enjoy this fantastic-looking Saab!\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThank you to RadarBox for supporting the creation of plane spotting videos on this channel!

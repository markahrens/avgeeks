The A220 by Airbus is also known as the C-Series by Bombardier. And Swiss was one of the first airlines to commit to the A220, which is why I jumped at the chance to try the plane on this journey from London's City Airport to Zurich. \n\nThe A220 is a great aircraft to fly out of London's challenging City Airport (LCY). If you watch this video, you'll see an amazing takeoff from London's City Airport, which is a unique airport.

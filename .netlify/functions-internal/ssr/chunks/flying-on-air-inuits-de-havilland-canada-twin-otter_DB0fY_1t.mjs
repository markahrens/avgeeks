Because of that, it’s an important hub for Air Inuit and for the communities along the Ungava Bay coast.\n\nFollowing a great trip there with my good friend @MarkBrandonAviation, it was time to head back home, and the first leg involved this Twin Otter to someplace I never thought I'd see again!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBecome a Channel Member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1SQ1Ffsm_13OQu7MwHXbA/join\n\nWebsite: https://www.alexpraglowski.ca\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexpraglowskiaviation\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/AlexPraglowski\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexPAviation\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFORMATION\nAirline: Air Inuit (3H/AIE)\nAircraft: De Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 (DHC6)\nFlight Number: 3H608\nSeat: 7D\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27\nRegistration: C-FAIY\nRoute: Kuujjuaq (YVP) - Puvirnituq (YPX)\nCallsign: INUIT 608\nRunway used: 31 (YVP) - 19 (YPX)\nDate filmed: April 2022\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nOutro song - \"Take Flight\" by Nyhtian: https://youtu.be/bCTTwQ_269c\n\n© Alex Praglowski Aviation 2022\n\nThis video is the property of Alex Praglowski Aviation and may not be used for any purpose without prior permission.

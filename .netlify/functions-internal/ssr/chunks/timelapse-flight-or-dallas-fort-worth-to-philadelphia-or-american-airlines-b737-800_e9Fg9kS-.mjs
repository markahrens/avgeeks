const data = {name:"Timelapse Flight | Dallas Fort-Worth to Philadelphia | American Airlines B737-800",description:"A timelapse flight from Dallas Fort-Worth to Philadelphia, operated onboard American Airlines Boeing 737-800 N880NN operating flight AA1327 on April 4 2016.\n\nThis video is dedicated to fellow passenger on this flight, SSG Travis Mills.  SSG Mills was heavily wounded while serving in Afghanistan, losing portions of all his limbs in an IED attack.  He is one of only five quadruple amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to survive his injuries.\n\nToday, he travels around the USA raising awareness for his foundation which was formed to benefit and assist wounded and injured veterans.\n\nPlease check out SSG Mills' website at travismills.org.\n\n=====\n\nOur trip today begins at gate A29, at Dallas Ft-Worth International (DFW).  We commence boarding, getting delayed in the air bridge as a first class passenger could not recline his seat, so boarding was delayed by around 15 minutes to allow maintenance to fix the seat.  We eventually continue boarding and take our seat in seat 9A.\n\nIt isn't long before we push back, and taxi out to runway 17R at DFW.  We depart to the south, climbing out over Dallas and making a left turn towards Arkansas.  We climb over northwest Texas, towards Texarkana, before crossing Arkansas getting a great view of Little Rock, AR.\n\nFrom there the cloud builds up below as we continue northwest over Missouri, crossing the southern corner of Illinois into Indiana, before making a right turn south of Indianapolis.  We then fly south of Dayton, Ohio, and Columbus, Ohio, before crossing into Pennsylvania south of Pittsburgh.  We then head east across PA, turning right over Harrisburg for an arrival that takes us over Lancaster and into the north of Philadelphia on a BOJID ONE arrival.  We break through the clouds into a rainy day in Philly, getting a good view over the city as we commence our approach into runway 27R at PHL.\n\nOnce we've landed, we taxi into the gate, where we shut down our engines.  At this point the captain welcomes us to Philadelphia and lets us know that we've had a wounded warrior on the flight today - Staff Sergeant Travis Mills, who was seriously wounded in Afghanistan losing all of his limbs in an IED attack.  The aircraft gives a rapturous round of applause to thank him for his service.  \n\nVideo taken from seat 9A.\n\nAirline:  American Airlines\nFlight:  AA1327\nAircraft:  Boeing 737-800 N880AN\nFrom:  Dallas Ft Worth (DFW)\nTo:  Philadelphia (PHL)\nDeparture:  15:42\nArrival:  19:23\nFlight Time:  02:41\nSeat:  9A\nFlight Path:  http://goo.gl/lBHYlG\n\n\n✈ ✈\nEquipment used:\n\nCamera: GoPro Hero4 Silver http://goo.gl/Wz7Uxt\nMount: Generic suction mount http://goo.gl/E2vRBs\nSwivel Mount: http://goo.gl/vWQVne\nBoya Frame Case for GoPro: http://goo.gl/tqM3H1\nBattery: Anker E7 25600mAh  http://goo.gl/ZXfxOy\nMicroSD cards: Sandisk 128GB http://goo.gl/KDjm4Y\n\n✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈✈\n\nWould you like to view my full flight videos ahead of everyone else, and support inflight Video at the same time?

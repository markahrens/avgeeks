const data = {name:"Diversion! United 777-224ER [N78013] Taxi and Takeoff from Calgary Airport ᴴᴰ",description:"Today, United Flight 7 from Houston to Tokyo-Narita diverted to Calgary due to a medical emergency on board. The flight diverted around 13:15 local time, and was delayed two hours leaving for another unknown reason. Here it is departing back on its way to Tokyo three hours after arriving. I wouldn't have made it to see this if not for that delay! Anyway, here's a former Continental 777-200ER built in 1999, taxiing and departing 35L, with ATC included. Enjoy this special visitor!\n\nI will be deleting any United-related comments. Just enjoy this video for what it is: a 777 with some killer sounding engines.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFLIGHT INFO\nAirline: United Airlines (UAL/UA)\nAircraft: Boeing 777-200ER\nAircraft Name: None\nLivery: Standard\nEngines: 2x GE GE90-92B \nRegistration: N78013\nRoute: IAH-(YYC)-NRT\nCallsign: United 7 heavy\nRunway used: 35L\nDate filmed: April 25, 2017\nLocal time: 1630\nFlightAware: http://flightaware.com/live/flight/N78013\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/dude8472productions/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dude8472_YYC\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dude8472productions\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/dude8472productions\nOfficial Website: https://www.dude8472productions.com\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n© dude8472productions 2017\n\nThis video is the property of dude8472productions and may not be used in any way without permission.",source:"youtube",source_id:"QHtFliKhcMc",type:"Flight",stops:[],postdate:new Date(1493166736000)};

Here we have PH-BVA, KLM's first 77W (and one of the first to get the new livery), landing on runway 17L, taxiing, and then departing again on runway 17L, the latter with a great GE90 spool up! ATC is included throughout, with an interesting conversation on the departure. Enjoy the first ever visit of KLM's new livery to Calgary International Airport!\n\nThanks for watching!
